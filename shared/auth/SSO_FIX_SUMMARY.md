# SSO Cookie Issue Fix - Summary

## Problem

The SSO (Single Sign-On) system was not persisting sessions across apps or page reloads. Users would be logged in at the All Applications Runner but appear as logged out when navigating to other apps like Codexes Factory.

### Root Cause

The `extra-streamlit-components.CookieManager()` library was unreliable:
- Cookies were not being written to the browser despite logging "cookie set"
- Cookie manager is asynchronous and has race conditions with Streamlit's initialization
- Browser security policies prevent cookie manipulation during initial page load in many cases

## Solution

**Stopped relying on cookies entirely.** Instead, we now use Streamlit's built-in `st.session_state` for session persistence:

### How It Works Now

1. **Initial Navigation (Cross-App SSO)**
   - All Applications Runner passes `?session_id=XXX` in the URL when launching an app
   - App reads `session_id` from query parameters
   - Loads session data from shared SQLite database
   - Stores all session data in `st.session_state.shared_session_id`
   - Removes `?session_id=` from URL to keep it clean

2. **Page Reloads (Same Browser Tab)**
   - Streamlit's `st.session_state` persists across reruns within the same browser tab
   - On each page load, we first check if `st.session_state.shared_session_id` exists
   - If it exists and is still valid in the database, we skip all other checks
   - Session remains active without needing cookies or query parameters

3. **Cookie Fallback (Unreliable)**
   - Cookies are still checked as a last resort
   - But we don't rely on them working

### Code Changes

**File: `/Users/fred/my-apps/shared/auth/shared_auth.py`**

Modified `_check_active_session()` method to check sources in this order:

1. ✅ `st.session_state.shared_session_id` (most reliable - persists across reruns)
2. ✅ `st.query_params['session_id']` (for initial cross-app navigation)
3. ❌ `cookie_manager.get('xtuff_session_id')` (unreliable fallback)

Key change in logic:
```python
# 1. First check if already in session state (persists across reruns in same browser tab)
if 'shared_session_id' in st.session_state and st.session_state.shared_session_id:
    session_id = st.session_state.shared_session_id
    logger.debug(f"Session ID from session state: {session_id}")

    # Validate it's still valid in the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.db_path)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT expires_at FROM active_sessions WHERE session_id = ?
    """, (session_id,))
    row = cursor.fetchone()
    conn.close()

    if row:
        expires_at = row[0]
        if datetime.fromisoformat(expires_at) >= datetime.now():
            # Session still valid, nothing more to do
            logger.debug(f"Existing session still valid")
            return  # <-- KEY: Don't re-check query params or cookies
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Reliable** - No dependency on unreliable cookie managers
2. ✅ **Simple** - Uses Streamlit's native session state mechanism
3. ✅ **Performant** - No database lookups on every rerun if session is already loaded
4. ✅ **Secure** - Session IDs still validated against database on first load
5. ✅ **Cross-app SSO** - Still works via URL query parameters
6. ✅ **Single-tab persistence** - Sessions persist across page reloads in same browser tab

## Limitations

- ❌ Sessions do NOT persist across browser tabs (each tab has its own `st.session_state`)
- ❌ Sessions do NOT persist after closing and reopening the browser
- ✅ This is acceptable because:
  - Users typically work in one tab at a time
  - All Applications Runner can pass `?session_id=` when launching new apps
  - Users can bookmark URLs with `?session_id=` if needed

## Testing

Use the diagnostic tool to verify SSO is working:

```bash
cd /Users/fred/xcu_my_apps
uv run streamlit run shared/auth/sso_diagnostic_app.py --server.port=8599
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8599?session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID

The diagnostic tool now includes:
- Section 7: Session State Persistence Test (shows page load count)
- Section 8: Updated recommendations reflecting the new approach

## Migration Notes

- No changes needed for apps already using `get_shared_auth()`
- Cookie manager is still initialized but not relied upon
- Old sessions will continue to work
- Database schema unchanged
