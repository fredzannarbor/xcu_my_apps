`/Users/fred/my-apps/all_applications_runner/resources/yaml/config.yaml`

### App Registry
`/Users/fred/my-apps/all_applications_runner/apps_config.json`

## Troubleshooting

### If login fails:
1. Verify config.yaml has the user account
2. Check password hash is correct (use test_auth_integration.py)
3. Ensure streamlit-authenticator is installed

### If subscription features don't work:
1. Verify session_state.subscription_tier is set correctly
2. Check check_subscription_access() function logic
3. Review apps_config.json subscription_features

### If app access fails:
1. Verify user's app_access field in config.yaml
2. Check auth_integration.py has_app_access() method
3. Confirm organization ID matches apps_config.json

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing user registration through central system
2. Add Stripe integration for actual subscription payments
3. Implement password reset functionality
4. Add email verification for new accounts
5. Create admin panel for user management

## Test Script

Run the verification script:
```bash
cd /Users/fred/xcu_my_apps/xtuff/ai-powered-resume-builder
python3 test_auth_integration.py
```

This will verify all test accounts are properly configured.
