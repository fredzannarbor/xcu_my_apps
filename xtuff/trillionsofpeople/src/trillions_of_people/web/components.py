The best available estimate is that about 117 billion unique humans have ever lived on Earth.
[(Population Reference Bureau, 2021).](https://www.prb.org/articles/how-many-people-have-ever-lived-on-earth/)
With new people being born at rate of about 133 million/year, this number is expected to rise to 121 billion by 2050,
about 129 billion by 2100, and, trends continuing, 250 billion by the year 3000 CE and one trillion by the year 9000 CE.
An optimist may hope that eventually there will be trillions of human lives. The numbers become even larger when you
add mythic and fictional characters, who have been born and died thousands of times, and have some of the most
interesting stories.

Sadly, the details of most of those lives are lost in the shadows of past and future. Many millenia of human history
are shrouded in near-complete mystery. (Graeber 2021). WikiBio dataset derived from Wikipedia's "biographical persons"
category has about 784,000 records; but only 200 of those are deemed "core biographies" by the WikiBio team and given
top-tier treatment. (WikiBio 2021)

This focus on a small percentage of all lives has important practical implications. Our understanding of lives in the
past is mostly limited to those few persons for whom we have written records or concrete artifacts; most are mysteries
--names, skeletons, or less. Similarly, one of the major difficulties in implementing far-sighted energy and climate
policies is that future people are abstractions.

_Trillions_ is a tool to make both past and futures feel more real, using state-of-the-art scientific, historical,
and artificial intelligence techniques. You, as an individual, can explore the lives of real-seeming people--past,
present, or future--in small numbers or large--and connect them with your personal story. You, as an organizational
leader, can quickly create and iterate through and personas that will give new energy and focus to your organization's
forward-looking vision.

A moment's thought will reveal that there could be an almost infinitely complex data object

relevant things that could be modeled as part of a complete simulation--their history, the
relationships among people, geography, climate, and on and on. So my approach of 'one row for
