# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for stabilizing the TrillionsOfPeople project and preparing it for release as a PyPI package. The project is a Streamlit application that generates synthetic people data for historical, present, and future scenarios. The stabilization effort will focus on code quality, packaging, testing, documentation, and deployment readiness to make it suitable for public distribution via PyPI.

3. WHEN package metadata is specified THEN it SHALL include author, description, license, and version information
4. WHEN build configuration is set THEN it SHALL use modern Python packaging standards
5. WHEN package is built THEN it SHALL create valid wheel and source distributions

### Requirement 4: Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests, so that I can ensure the package works correctly and catch regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL have unit tests for core functionality
2. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL achieve at least 70% code coverage
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL pass consistently across different Python versions
4. WHEN integration tests exist THEN they SHALL verify key user workflows
5. WHEN test framework is configured THEN it SHALL use pytest with appropriate fixtures

### Requirement 5: Documentation

**User Story:** As a user of the package, I want clear documentation, so that I can understand how to install and use the package effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL have a comprehensive README.md file
2. WHEN API documentation exists THEN it SHALL include docstrings for all public functions and classes
3. WHEN installation instructions are provided THEN they SHALL be clear and accurate
4. WHEN usage examples exist THEN they SHALL demonstrate key functionality
5. WHEN changelog is maintained THEN it SHALL document version changes and breaking changes

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling and informative messages, so that I can understand and resolve issues when they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
2. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL be properly caught and handled
3. WHEN logging is implemented THEN it SHALL use appropriate log levels and formatting
4. WHEN API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance
5. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want flexible configuration options, so that I can customize the package behavior for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL support environment variables
2. WHEN default settings exist THEN they SHALL be reasonable and documented
3. WHEN configuration files are used THEN they SHALL follow standard formats (JSON, YAML, or TOML)
4. WHEN API keys are required THEN the system SHALL support multiple input methods
5. WHEN settings are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages

### Requirement 8: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the package to perform well and be reliable, so that it works efficiently in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large datasets are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently
2. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN it SHALL remain within reasonable bounds
3. WHEN external APIs are called THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic
4. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle them safely
5. WHEN resources are used THEN they SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement 9: Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the package to handle sensitive data safely, so that my API keys and data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are handled THEN they SHALL not be logged or exposed in error messages
2. WHEN file operations occur THEN they SHALL validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
3. WHEN user input is processed THEN it SHALL be properly sanitized
4. WHEN temporary files are created THEN they SHALL be securely managed and cleaned up
5. WHEN dependencies are used THEN they SHALL be regularly updated for security patches

### Requirement 10: Deployment and Distribution

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want automated deployment processes, so that releases can be made reliably and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN releases are made THEN the system SHALL have automated CI/CD pipelines
2. WHEN packages are built THEN they SHALL be tested across multiple Python versions
3. WHEN PyPI uploads occur THEN they SHALL be automated and secure
4. WHEN version numbers are managed THEN they SHALL follow semantic versioning
5. WHEN release notes are generated THEN they SHALL be automatically created from changelog

### Requirement 11: Commerce Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to be able to offer subscriptions to the service, so that I can monetize the platform and provide tiered access to features.

#### Acceptance Criteria
