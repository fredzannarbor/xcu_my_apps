He is the author of the  Hyperion Cantos and the  Ilium/Olympos cycles, among other works which span the science fiction, horror, and fantasy genres, sometimes within a single novel. Simmons's genre-intermingling'' Song of Kali'' (1985) won the World Fantasy Award. He also writes mysteries and thrillers, some of which feature the continuing character Joe Kurtz.\n", "Born in Peoria, Illinois, Simmons received a B.A. in English from Wabash College in 1970 and, in 1971, a Masters in Education from Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nHe soon started writing short stories, although his career did not take off until 1982, when, through Harlan Ellison's help, his short story \"The River Styx Runs Upstream\" was published and awarded first prize in a ''Twilight Zone Magazine'' story competition, and he was taken on as a client by Ellison's agent, Richard Curtis. Simmons's first novel, ''Song of Kali'', was released in 1985.\n\nHe worked in elementary education until 1989.\n", "''Summer of Night'' (1991) recounts the childhood of a group of pre-teens who band together in the 1960s, to defeat a centuries-old evil that terrorizes their hometown of Elm Haven, Illinois. The novel, which was praised by Stephen King in a cover blurb, is similar to King's ''It'' (1986) in its focus on small town life, the corruption of innocence, the return of an ancient evil, and the responsibility for others that emerges with the transition from youth to adulthood.\n\nIn the sequel to ''Summer of Night'', ''A Winter Haunting'' (2002), Dale Stewart (one of the first book's protagonists and now an adult), revisits his boyhood home to come to grips with mysteries that have disrupted his adult life.\n\nBetween the publication of ''Summer of Night'' (1991) and ''A Winter Haunting'' (2002), several additional characters from ''Summer of Night'' appeared in: ''Children of the Night'' (1992), a loose sequel to ''Summer of Night'', which features Mike O'Rourke, now much older and a Roman Catholic priest, who is sent on a mission to investigate bizarre events in a European city; ''Fires of Eden'' (1994), in which the adult Cordie Cooke appears; and ''Darwin's Blade'' (2000), a thriller in which Dale's younger brother, Lawrence Stewart, appears as a minor character.\n\nAfter ''Summer of Night'', Simmons focused on writing science fiction until the 2007 work of historical fiction and horror, ''The Terror''. His 2009 book ''Drood'' is based on the last years of Charles Dickens' life leading up to the writing of ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood'', which Dickens had partially completed at the time of his death.\n", "''The Terror'' (2007) crosses the bridge between horror and historical fiction. It is a fictionalized account of Sir John Franklin and his expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The two ships,  and , become icebound the first winter, and the captains and crew struggle to survive while being stalked across an Arctic landscape by a monster.\n\n''The Abominable'' (2013) recounts a mid-1920s attempt on Mount Everest by five climbers\u2014two British, one French, one Sherpa, and one American (the narrator)\u2014to recover the body of a cousin of one the British characters.\n", "Many of Simmons's works have strong ties with classic literature. For example:\n* His  1989 novel ''Hyperion'', winner of Hugo and Locus Awards for the best science fiction novel, deals with a space war and is inspired in its structure by Boccaccio's ''Decameron'' and Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''.\n* The ''Hyperion Cantos'' take their titles from poems by the British Romantic John Keats.\n* The title of ''Carrion Comfort'', as well as many of its themes, derives from the poem \"Carrion Comfort\" by Gerard Manley Hopkins.\n* ''The Hollow Man'' (1992) is a novel influenced by Dante's ''Inferno'' and T. S. Eliot\n* \"The Great Lover\" (1993) is a short story inspired by the World War I War Poets\n* Simmons's collection of short stories, ''Worlds Enough & Time'', takes its name from the first line of the poem \"To His Coy Mistress\" by British poet Andrew Marvell: \"Had we but world enough, and time\"\n* The detective in ''Flashback'' is named Nick Bottom after a character in Shakespeare's ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''\n", "\n=== Novels ===\n\n;''Hyperion Cantos'' series:\n\n# ''Hyperion'' (1989) \u2013 Hugo and Locus Awards winner, BSFA nominee, 1990; Arthur C.
