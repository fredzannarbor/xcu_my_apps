{"title": "Ayn Rand", "section_titles": ["Introduction", "Life", "Literary method and influences", "Philosophy", "Reception and legacy", "Selected works", "Notes", "References", "External links"], "section_texts": ["\n\n\n\n'''Alice O'Connor''' (born '''Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum'''; \u00a0\u2013 March 6, 1982), better known by her pen name '''Ayn Rand''' (), was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She wrote a play that opened on Broadway in 1935. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''The Fountainhead''. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel ''Atlas Shrugged''. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge; she rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism, statism, and anarchism. Instead, she supported ''laissez-faire'' capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including private property rights. Although Rand opposed libertarianism, which she viewed as anarchism, she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.\n\nRand's fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics. Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death, academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor. Her writings have politically influenced some libertarians and conservatives. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.\n", "\n===Early life===\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February\u00a02, 1905, to a Russian-Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg. She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum, a pharmacist, and Anna Borisovna (n\u00e9e Kaplan). Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at age eight and novels at age ten. At the prestigious , her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokov's younger sister, Olga; the pair shared an intense interest in politics.\n\nRand completed a three-year program at Petrograd State University.\nShe was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which Rand favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas\u00a0II. The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. While in high school there, Rand concluded she was an atheist and valued reason above any other virtue. After graduating in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was then renamed), where they faced desperate conditions, occasionally nearly starving.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University. At 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history. At the university, she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato; Rand came to see their differing views on reality and knowledge as the primary conflict within philosophy. She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nRand's first published work was a monograph in Russian about actress Pola Negri.\nAlong with many other bourgeois students, she was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate, which she did in October 1924. She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment, Rand wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.\n\nBy this time, she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'', possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt  of her birth surname  in Cyrillic. She adopted the first name ''Ayn''.\n\n\n===Arrival in the United States===\nIn late 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago. She departed on January\u00a017, 1926. Arriving in New York City on February\u00a019, 1926, Rand was so impressed with the Manhattan skyline that she cried what she later called \"tears of splendor\". Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives. One of them owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films free of charge. She then left for Hollywood, California.\n\nIn Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra in his film ''The King of Kings'' and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter. While working on ''The King of Kings'', she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two married on April\u00a015, 1929. She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March\u00a03, 1931. She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate.\n\nDuring these early years of her career, Rand wrote a number of screenplays, plays, and short stories that were not produced or published during her lifetime; some were published later in ''The Early Ayn Rand''.\n\n===Early fiction===\n\nRand's play ''Night of January\u00a016th'' opened on Broadway in 1935.\nAlthough it was never produced, Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''Red Pawn'' to Universal Studios in 1932.  Her courtroom drama ''Night of January\u00a016th'', first produced by E.\u00a0E.\u00a0Clive in Hollywood in 1934, reopened successfully on Broadway in 1935. Each night, a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on its vote, one of two different endings would be performed.\n\nHer first published novel, the semi-autobiographical ''We the Living'', was published in 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. Initial sales were slow, and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell. She adapted the story as a stage play, but producer George Abbott's Broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies. In a foreword to the 1959 edition, Rand wrote that ''We the Living'' \"is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. ... The plot is invented, the background is not\u00a0...\".\n\nRand wrote her novella ''Anthem'' during a break from writing her next major novel, ''The Fountainhead''. It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word ''I'' has been forgotten and replaced with ''we''. Published in England in 1938, Rand could not find an American publisher initially. As with ''We the Living'', Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold over 3.5\u00a0million copies.\n\n===''The Fountainhead'' and political activism===\n\nDuring the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for Republican Wendell Willkie's 1940 presidential campaign. This led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had seen pro-Willkie newsreels. Her work brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt, who introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to her as \"the most courageous man in America\", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said \"man\" instead of \"woman\". Rand became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson. Rand questioned her about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings, and gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book, ''The God of the Machine''.\n\n''The Fountainhead'' was Rand's first bestseller.\nRand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with ''The Fountainhead'', a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as \"second-handers\"\u2014those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. Twelve publishers rejected it before the Bobbs-Merrill Company finally accepted it at the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.\n\n''The Fountainhead'' became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. In 1943, she sold the film rights to Warner Bros. and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Producer Hal B. Wallis hired her afterwards as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for him included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated ''Love Letters'' and ''You Came Along''. Rand worked on other projects, including a never-completed nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''.\n\n\nRand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the anti-Communist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association. A visit by Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a falling out between the two when Paterson made comments to valued political allies which Rand considered rude. In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a \"friendly witness\" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee that the 1944 film ''Song of Russia'' grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it was. She also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but was not allowed to do so. When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations' effectiveness, Rand described the process as \"futile\".\n\nAfter several delays, the film version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she \"disliked the movie from beginning to end\" and complained about its editing, the acting and other elements.\n\n===''Atlas Shrugged'' and Objectivism===\n\nRand's novella ''Anthem'' was reprinted in the June 1953 issue of the pulp magazine ''Famous Fantastic Mysteries''.\nFollowing the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book had influenced profoundly. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated \"The Collective\") included a future chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. Initially, the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy. Later, Rand began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as she wrote the manuscript. In 1954, her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the knowledge of their spouses.\n\nPublished in 1957, ''Atlas Shrugged'' was considered Rand's ''magnum opus''. She described the novel's theme as \"the role of the mind in man's existence\u2014and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest\". It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes it as \"stopping the motor of the world\" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nation's wealth and achievements. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of mystery, romance, and science fiction, and contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.\n\nDespite many negative reviews, ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller, however, the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand. ''Atlas Shrugged'' was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.\n\nIn 1958, Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for the NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that Rand edited. She later published some of these articles in book form. Rand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of the NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand. Some described the NBI or the Objectivist movement as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair. Some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.\n\n===Later years===\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Harvard, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding to questions from the audience. During these appearances, she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day. These included: supporting abortion rights, opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as \"bums\"), supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as \"civilized men fighting savages\", saying white colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by American Indians, and calling homosexuality \"immoral\" and \"disgusting\", while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it. She endorsed several Republican candidates for president of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for ''The Objectivist Newsletter''.\n\nGrave marker for Rand and her husband at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York\nIn 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens, and the NBI was closed. She published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other \"irrational behavior in his private life\". In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.\n\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking. In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, after her initial objections, allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare. During the late 1970s, her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November\u00a09, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of ''Atlas Shrugged''.\n\nOn March\u00a06, 1982, Rand died of heart failure at her home in New York City. She was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York. At her funeral, a  floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff as her beneficiary.\n\n", "Rand described her approach to literature as \"romantic realism\". She wanted her fiction to present the world \"as it could be and should be\", rather than as it was. This approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters. Her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists, depicted as fit and attractive. Her stories' villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals. Rand often describes them as unattractive and they sometimes have names that suggest negative traits, like Wesley Mouch in ''Atlas Shrugged''.\n\nRand considered plot a critical element of literature, and her stories typically have what biographer Anne Heller described as \"tight, elaborate, fast-paced plotting\". Romantic triangles are a common plot element in Rand's fiction; in most of her novels and plays, the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men.\n\n===Influences===\nRand admired the novels of French author Victor Hugo.\nIn school Rand read works by Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her favorites. She considered them to be among the \"top rank\" of Romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots. Hugo, in particular, was an important influence on her writing, especially her approach to plotting. In the introduction she wrote for an English-language edition of his novel ''Ninety-Three'', Rand called him \"the greatest novelist in world literature\". \n\nAlthough Rand disliked most Russian literature, her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the Russian Symbolists and other nineteenth-century Russian writing, most notably the 1863 novel ''What Is to Be Done?'' by Nikolay Chernyshevsky. Rand's experience of the Russian Revolution and early Communist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains. This is most apparent in ''We the Living'', set in Russia. The ideas and rhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in ''The Fountainhead'' and the destruction of the economy by the looters in ''Atlas Shrugged'' also reflect it.\n\nRand's descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios. They often follow common film editing conventions, such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close-up details, and her descriptions of women characters often take a \"male gaze\" perspective.\n", "\n\nRand called her philosophy \"Objectivism\", describing its essence as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\". She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.\n\nIn metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion. Rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism.\n\nIn epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which Rand considered axiomatic, and reason, which she described as \"the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses\". Rand rejected all claims of non-perceptual or ''a priori'' knowledge, including instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing. In her ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'', Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic\u2013synthetic dichotomy.\n\nIn ethics, Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should \"exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself\". Rand referred to egoism as \"the virtue of selfishness\" in her book of that title. In it, she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of \"man's survival qua man\". She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in ''Atlas Shrugged'' that, \"Force and mind are opposites.\"\n\nRand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights\u2014including property rights. She considered ''laissez-faire'' capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights. Rand opposed statism, which she understood included theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship. She believed a constitutionally limited government should protect natural rights. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, Rand preferred the term \"radical for capitalism\". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. Rand denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a na\u00efve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.\n\nIn aesthetics, Rand defined art as a \"selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments\". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness. As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature. She considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will.\n\nRand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her \"theory of concepts, ethics, and discovery in politics that evil\u2014the violation of rights\u2014consists of the initiation of force\". She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating: \"I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.\"\n\n===Criticisms===\nRand's ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy. Numerous authors, including Robert Nozick and William F. O'Neill, in some of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas, said she failed in her attempt to solve the is\u2013ought problem. Critics have called her definitions of ''egoism'' and ''altruism'' biased and inconsistent with normal usage. Critics from religious traditions oppose her rejection of altruism in addition to atheism. Essays criticizing Rand's egoistic views are included in a number of anthologies for teaching introductory ethics, often including no essays presenting or defending them.\n\nMultiple critics, including Nozick, have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails. Others, like Michael Huemer, have gone further, saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions. Some critics, like Roy Childs, have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism, rather than limited government.\n\nCommentators, including Hazel Barnes, Albert Ellis, and Nathaniel Branden, have criticized Rand's focus on the importance of reason. Branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be.\n\n===Relationship to other philosophers===\n\nExcept for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals, Rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her. Acknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence, Rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\"\u2014Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded: \"Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.\"\n\nIn an article for the ''Claremont Review of Books'', political scientist Charles Murray criticized her claim that her only \"philosophical debt\" was to Aristotle. He asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche. Rand found early inspiration from Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of this in Rand's private journals. In 1928, she alluded to his idea of the \"superman\" in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer William Edward Hickman. There are other indications of Nietzsche's influence in passages from the first edition of ''We the Living'' (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. By the time she wrote ''The Fountainhead'', Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed.\n\nRand considered her philosophical opposite to be Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as \"the most evil man in mankind's history\"; she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self-interest. Philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.\n", "\n===Critical reception===\nRand in 1957\nThe first reviews Rand received were for ''Night of January 16th''. Reviews of the Broadway production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer. Although Rand believed that her novel ''We the Living'' was not widely reviewed, over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews. Overall, they were more positive than those she received for her later work. Her 1938 novella ''Anthem'' received little review attention, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.\n\nRand's first bestseller, ''The Fountainhead'', received far fewer reviews than ''We the Living'', and reviewers' opinions were mixed. Lorine Pruette's positive review in ''The New York Times'' was one that Rand greatly appreciated. Pruette called her \"a writer of great power\" who wrote \"brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly\", and said \"you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time\". There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the novel's length; one called it \"a whale of a book\" and another said \"anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing\". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style \"offensively pedestrian\".\n\n''Atlas Shrugged'' was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative. In ''National Review'', conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book \"sophomoric\" and \"remarkably silly\". He described the book's tone as \"shrillness without reprieve\". He accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming, \"From almost any page of ''Atlas Shrugged'', a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber\u2014go!. ''Atlas Shrugged'' received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain. Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that \"reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs\", saying it was \"execrable claptrap\", \"written out of hate\", and showed \"remorseless hectoring and prolixity\".\n\nRand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, ''For the New Intellectual'', was similar to that for ''Atlas Shrugged''. Philosopher Sidney Hook likened her certainty to \"the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union\", and author Gore Vidal called her viewpoint \"nearly perfect in its immorality\". Her subsequent books got progressively less review attention.\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, writing for ''The New York Times'', Edward Rothstein referred to her written fiction as quaint utopian \"retro fantasy\" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist, while criticizing her characters' \"isolated rejection of democratic society\".\n\n===Popular interest===\n''Atlas Shrugged'' has sold more than nine million copies.\nWith over 30\u00a0million copies sold , Rand's books continue to be read widely. A survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives. Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged'' was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work.\n\nRand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, like Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith; she has influenced later writers like Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind. Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush, although he later distanced himself. Rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas. Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks) as well as John P. Mackey (CEO of Whole Foods), among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.\n\nTelevision shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as movies and video games have referred to Rand and her works. Throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines, as well as book-length critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis and Trinity Foundation president John W. Robbins. Rand, or characters based on her, figure prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors. Nick Gillespie, former editor-in- chief of ''Reason'', remarked that, \"Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist. Jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture.\" Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, ''Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life'', was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'', a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards. Rand's image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano.\n\nRand's works have found a foothold in classrooms. Since 2002, the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rand's novels to high school teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum. The Institute had distributed 4.5\u00a0million copies in the U.S. and Canada by the end of 2020. In 2017, Rand was added to the required reading list for the A Level Politics exam in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n===Political influence===\n\n\nAlthough she rejected the labels \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\", Rand has had a continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism. Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism. David Nolan, one founder of the Libertarian Party, said that \"without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist\". In his history of that movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as \"the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large\". Historian Jennifer Burns referred to her as \"the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\".\n\nA protester's sign at a 2009 Tea Party rally refers to John Galt, the hero of Rand's ''Atlas Shrugged''.\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party), despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative, like being pro-choice and an atheist. She faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley Jr. and other contributors to the conservative ''National Review'' magazine, which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas. Nevertheless, a 1987 article in ''The New York Times'' referred to her as the Reagan administration's \"novelist laureate\". Republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels. She has influenced some conservative politicians outside the U.S., such as Sajid Javid in the United Kingdom, Siv Jensen in Norway, and Ayelet Shaked in Israel.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially ''Atlas Shrugged'', which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis. Opinion articles compared real-world events with the novel's plot. Signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests. There was increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left. Critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan. In 2015, Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan, \"Rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy\". Lisa Duggan said that Rand's novels had \"incalculable impact\" in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas. In 2021, Cass Sunstein said Rand's ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the Trump administration, which he attributed to the \"enduring influence\" of Rand's fiction.\n\n\n===Academic reaction===\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars. Since her death, interest in her work has increased gradually. In 2009, historian Jennifer Burns identified \"three overlapping waves\" of scholarly interest in Rand, including \"an explosion of scholarship\" since the year 2000. However, as of that same year, few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study. From 2002 to 2012, over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation that required teaching Rand's ideas or works; in some cases, the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about Rand. In 2020, media critic Eric Burns said that, \"Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime\",  but \"nobody in the academe pays any attention to her, neither as an author nor a philosopher. That same year, the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held \"a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule\" her work, but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years.\n\n====To her ideas====\n\nIn 1967, John Hospers discussed Rand's ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook, ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis''. That same year, Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing Objectivism in her book ''An Existentialist Ethics''. When the first full-length academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand \"a treacherous undertaking\" that could lead to \"guilt by association\" for taking her seriously. A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in ''The Personalist''. One of these was \"On the Randian Argument\" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who criticized her meta-ethical arguments. Other philosophers, writing in the same publication, argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case. In an article responding to Nozick, Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen defended her positions, but described her style as \"literary, hyperbolic and emotional\".\n\n''The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand'', a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by Den Uyl and Rasmussen, was the first academic book about Rand's ideas published after her death. In one essay, political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite \"the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage\", Rand's ethics are \"a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought\". In 1987, Allan Gotthelf, George Walsh, and David Kelley co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the American Philosophical Association.\n\nIn a 1995 entry about Rand in ''Contemporary Women Philosophers'', Jenny A. Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand. She said that Rand's philosophy \"is regularly omitted from academic philosophy. Yet, throughout literary academia, Ayn Rand is considered a philosopher.\" Writing in the 1998 edition of the ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', political theorist Chandran Kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts. He said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotle's ethics, and her political theory \"is of little interest\" because it is marred by an \"ill-thought out and unsystematic\" effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism. ''The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'', a multidisciplinary, peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of Rand and her ideas, was established in 1999. R. W. Bradford, Stephen D. Cox, and Chris Matthew Sciabarra were its founding co-editors.\n\nIn a 2010 essay for the Cato Institute, libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer argued very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics. He attributed the attention she receives to her being a \"compelling writer\", especially as a novelist, noting that ''Atlas Shrugged'' outsells Rand's non-fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism. In 2012, the Pennsylvania State University Press agreed to take over publication of ''The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies'', and the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an \"Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies\" series based on the Society's proceedings. That same year, political scientist Alan Wolfe dismissed Rand as a \"nonperson\" among academics. The Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' said that \"only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously\".\n\n====To her fiction====\nAcademic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy. Mimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s. Since her death, scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s. Several academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her works. These include Twayne's United States Authors (''Ayn Rand'' by James T. Baker), Twayne's Masterwork Studies (''The Fountainhead: An American Novel'' by Den Uyl and ''Atlas Shrugged: Manifesto of the Mind'' by Gladstein), and Re-reading the Canon (''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'', edited by Gladstein and Sciabarra), as well as in popular study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes. In ''The Literary Encyclopedia'' entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that \"Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation.\" In 2019, Lisa Duggan described Rand's fiction as popular and influential on many readers, despite being easy to criticize for \"her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots, her rigid moralizing, her middle- to lowbrow aesthetic preferences\u00a0... and philosophical strivings\".\n\n===Objectivist movement===\nRand's heir Leonard Peikoff co-founded the Ayn Rand Institute.\n\nAfter the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute, the Objectivist movement continued in other forms. In the 1970s, Leonard Peikoff began delivering courses on Objectivism. In 1979, Objectivist writer Peter Schwartz started a newsletter called ''The Intellectual Activist'', which Rand endorsed. She also endorsed ''The Objectivist Forum'', a bimonthly magazine founded by Objectivist philosopher Harry Binswanger, which ran from 1980 to 1987.\n\nIn 1985, Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society. In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.\n", "\n\n\n'''Fiction and drama:'''\n* ''Night of January 16th'' (performed 1934, published 1968)\n* ''We the Living'' (1936, revised 1959)\n* ''Anthem'' (1938, revised 1946)\n* ''The Unconquered'' (performed 1940, published 2014)\n* ''The Fountainhead'' (1943)\n* ''Atlas Shrugged'' (1957)\n* ''The Early Ayn Rand'' (1984)\n* ''Ideal'' (2015)\n\n'''Non-fiction:'''\n* ''For the New Intellectual'' (1961)\n* ''The Virtue of Selfishness'' (1964)\n* ''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal'' (1966, expanded 1967)\n* ''The Romantic Manifesto'' (1969, expanded 1975)\n* ''The New Left'' (1971, expanded 1975)\n* ''Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology'' (1979, expanded 1990)\n* ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'' (1982)\n* ''Letters of Ayn Rand'' (1995)\n* ''Journals of Ayn Rand'' (1997)\n\n", "\n", "\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  Reprinted from ''Esquire'', July 1961.\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n", "\n*  Frequently Asked Questions About Ayn Rand from the Ayn Rand Institute\n* \n* \n* \n*  Rand's papers at The Library of Congress\n*  Ayn Rand Lexicon \u2013 searchable database\n* \n* \n* \n* \n*  \"Writings of Ayn Rand\" \u2013 from C-SPAN's ''American Writers: A Journey Through History''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], "interlinks": [["pen name", "pen name"], ["Objectivism", "Objectivism"], ["Broadway theatre", "Broadway"], ["The Fountainhead", "The Fountainhead"], ["Atlas Shrugged", "Atlas Shrugged"], ["Objectivist periodicals", "periodicals"], ["reason", "reason"], ["faith", "faith"], ["Rational egoism", "rational"], ["ethical egoism", "ethical egoism"], ["Altruism (ethics)", "altruism"], ["initiation of force", "initiation of force"], ["collectivism", "collectivism"], ["statism", "statism"], ["anarchism", "anarchism"], ["laissez-faire", "laissez-faire"], ["capitalism", "capitalism"], ["individual rights", "individual rights"], ["private property", "private property"], ["libertarianism", "libertarianism"], ["libertarian movement in the United States", "libertarian movement in the United States"], ["romantic realism", "romantic realism"], ["Aristotle", "Aristotle"], ["Thomas Aquinas", "Thomas Aquinas"], ["classical liberals", "classical liberals"], ["conservatives", "conservatives"], ["Objectivist movement", "Objectivist movement"], ["Russian-Jewish", "Russian-Jewish"], ["Saint Petersburg", "Saint Petersburg"], ["Vladimir Nabokov", "Vladimir Nabokov"], ["Petrograd State University.", "Petrograd State University."], ["February Revolution", "February Revolution"], ["Alexander Kerensky", "Alexander Kerensky"], ["Tsar", "Tsar"], ["Nicholas\u00a0II", "Nicholas\u00a0II"], ["October Revolution", "October Revolution"], ["Bolsheviks", "Bolsheviks"], ["Vladimir Lenin", "Vladimir Lenin"], ["Crimean Peninsula", "Crimean Peninsula"], ["White Army", "White Army"], ["Russian Civil War", "Russian Civil War"], ["atheist", "atheist"], ["reason", "reason"], ["Petrograd State University", "Petrograd State University"], ["social pedagogy", "social pedagogy"], ["Aristotle", "Aristotle"], ["Plato", "Plato"], ["Friedrich Nietzsche", "Friedrich Nietzsche"], ["Tekhnikum", "Technicum"], ["Pola Negri", "Pola Negri"], ["Cyrillic", "Cyrillic"], ["Travel visa", "visa"], ["Manhattan", "Manhattan"], ["Cecil B.
