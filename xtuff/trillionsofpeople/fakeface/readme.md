This API returns image URLs of fake human faces generated by [thispersondoesnotexist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com).

![alt text](https://fakeface.rest/thumb/view/7 "Dynamically generated image")

Each image has been pre-analysed by an AI algorithm called [pypy-agender](https://github.com/aristofun/py-agender) to identify gender and age (obviously non-exact).

As such, the user of the API can specify gender, minimum and maximum age for the image to be returned.

Data can be returned via JSON format, a direct redirect to the image or a simple response with the image URL.
