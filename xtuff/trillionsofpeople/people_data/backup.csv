Backstory: Klieuncy was born in the area now known as India. Her father was a tribal leader and her mother was a healer who lived in a small hut outside his village. Her mother would often pass on her skills to Klieuncy and teach her how to use herbs, roots, and leaves to help heal wounds, cure illnesses, and see into the future. When Klieuncy was six years old, her mother passed away and her father decided to send her to be a healer in the city. 

Klieuncy's life in the city was difficult, as she was treated differently because of her ethnicity. She often felt like an outsider and was often the target of bullying. She often stayed at the city library where she would read anything she could get her hands on to learn more about healing and the world around her. As she grew up, she learned more about the city and grew to love the culture and people. She spent her time healing the sick but also teaching the city children how to grow herbs and cook. 

When she was 21, Klieuncy's father died and she returned to the hut in the forest. She continued to heal and teach the local tribes until she was 23. She was then asked by the council to become the leader of the tribe and she accepted.

The person described is Klieuncy, a healer who was born in the area now known as India.

Qaarly was born in the area now known as Moldova. Her parents were farmers, and they had enough land to support themselves and their child. When Qaarly was six years old, her father died, and the family was forced to move in with her grandfather and his wife. The new home was much smaller, and they often had to farm extra land and work harder to grow food. One day, when she was twelve years old, her grandfather told her a story about how he and his wife had once been very happy. They had many children, and the family had a lot of land. But then, their children began to leave, and the land that remained was divided in half. They could no longer afford to buy food, and they decided to sell all the land that remained and move to the small house where they lived now.

Qaarly remembers being very angry, because her parents had never told her the story. She decided that she would not live in the same way as her grandparents and would not sell her land. She was going to save as much as she could for the future. As she grew older, she continued to save as much as possible. Every time she had enough money, she would buy more land and pass the amount she had saved on to her grandparents. Eventually, she became a farmer herself and has been able to support her family since.","unchary-Gisella-enervating-assumably","TOP.info","This is a comment","Register | Authenticate | Claim | Mint"

The other boys would tease him for being so small compared to them, and his mother would scold him for not having any food to put on his plate.

Hypif's childhood was pretty hard. He was constantly hungry, and the other boys bullied him to get back at their parents for giving him so much food. Sometimes they would steal into his house while he was sleeping, take any food they could find, and leave him with a ration of water and a dry meal.

When Hypif finally turned thirteen, he could no longer bear it. He left his home, and traveled to the capital city. He found work as a servant in a nobleman's house, and lived on whatever scraps the nobles threw him. He was treated like trash, and used for the sole purpose of providing for the nobles' children.

When the time came to send the children back to their parents, Hypif was unceremoniously pushed out of the house. He was too ashamed to return to his home, and instead set off on a journey to find work. He wandered for many months, until he finally found a village that would accept him.

In French Guiana, Chrautts was one of a family of six who were all born without the power to work magic. They lived a life of poverty, but things started changing for them when Chrautts was sixteen years old.

As he became older, Chrautts began to be drawn more and more to the idea of magic. He began to study it and to practice it, and he soon found out that he had a great talent for it. 

After a while, Chrautts was able to begin teaching his family, and soon enough, they too were able to use the power of magic.

Despite the fact that they were now able to use magic, the family still lived in poverty. They were constantly moving, trying to find a place where they could live, work, and be free.
