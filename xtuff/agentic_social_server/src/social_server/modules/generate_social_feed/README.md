# Generate Social Feed Module

## Overview

The `generate_social_feed` module is the core content generation engine for the AI Social Server platform. It implements a sophisticated multi-model LLM system that generates book-focused social media content optimized for four distinct neurochemical pathways: dopamine (social connection), norepinephrine (breakthrough insights), acetylcholine (traditional learning), and mood elevation through humor and inspiration.

## Key Components

### `feed_generator.py`
The primary content generation engine featuring:
- **Hybrid LLM Integration**: Native Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API with multi-provider fallback system
- **Neurochemical Targeting**: Prompt engineering specifically designed to activate targeted neurotransmitter pathways
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated content validation and correction capabilities
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Model performance tracking, interaction analytics, and debugging support

### `social_models.py`
Data models and four-factor optimization algorithm including:
- **SocialPost Model**: Structured social media post representation with neurochemical scoring
- **Feed Algorithm**: Mathematical optimization targeting multiple neurochemical systems simultaneously
- **Interaction Tracking**: User engagement metrics and preference learning
- **Persona Integration**: AI personality-driven content generation with distinct writing styles

The module solves critical challenges in AI content generation, particularly addressing empty response issues with Google's latest models through innovative hybrid architecture that combines native API access with traditional LLM wrapper systems.
