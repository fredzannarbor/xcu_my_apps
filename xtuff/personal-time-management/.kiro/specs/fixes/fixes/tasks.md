# Implementation Plan for Fixes

- [x] 1. **Fix Quick Stats Rendering**:
  - Locate the `render_quick_stats` function in `daily_engine.py`.
  - Correct the data fetching and rendering logic to display actual values.

- [x] 2. **Resolve `render_app_management_settings` `NameError`**:
  - Define the `render_app_management_settings` function in an appropriate location, likely `streamlit_app_manager.py` or `ui/settings_ui.py`.
  - Import the function into `ui/settings_ui.py`.
  - Ensure the function correctly renders the app management UI.

- [x] 3. **Implement Micro-task Functionality**:
  - Add a UI element (e.g., a button or form) to add micro-tasks.
  - Implement the backend logic to store and manage micro-tasks.

- [x] 4. **Implement Countable-task Functionality**:
  - Add a UI element to log countable tasks.
  - Modify the database schema to include a table for countable tasks with timestamps and counts.
  - Implement the logic to increment the count for a task when it's logged within the same day.

- [x] 5. **Complete RTask 15: Integrate app management into settings UI**:
  - Implement the UI for starting, stopping, and restarting apps from the settings page.
  - Display the status of each managed application.

- [x] 6. **Complete RTask 16: Implement programmatic API**:
  - Expose functions for managing apps that can be called from other Python scripts.
  - Document the API.

- [x] 7. **Complete RTask 17: Build comprehensive test suite**:
  - Write unit tests for the new functionality.
  - Write integration tests for the app management system.

- [x] 8. **Complete RTask 18: System integration and final wiring**:
  - Ensure all new components are correctly integrated into the main application.
  - Perform end-to-end testing.
