# Design Document for Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a series of fixes and feature completions for the Streamlit-based personal time management application. The primary goals are to address rendering errors, resolve undefined function calls, implement new task types, and complete the remaining tasks from the `streamlit-app-manager` project.

## Component Fixes

### 1. Quick Stats Rendering

**Problem:** The "Quick Stats" component in `daily_engine.py` is not rendering the dynamic data correctly, showing placeholders instead of actual values.

**Solution:** The rendering logic in `daily_engine.py` will be corrected to properly fetch and display the latest data for energy levels, habit completion, revenue, and creative activities. This involves ensuring the data is available and correctly formatted before being passed to the Streamlit UI.

### 2. App Management Settings Rendering

**Problem:** A `NameError` occurs because `render_app_management_settings` is called in `ui/settings_ui.py` but is not defined or imported.

**Solution:** The `render_app_management_settings` function will be defined, likely within `streamlit_app_manager.py` or a new UI-specific file, and then imported correctly into `ui/settings_ui.py`. This function will be responsible for rendering the UI components for managing Streamlit applications.

### 3. New Task Types: Micro-task and Countable-task

**Problem:** The application needs to support two new types of tasks: "micro-tasks" and "countable-tasks".

**Solution:**
- **Micro-tasks:** A new function will be added to allow the addition of small, quick tasks.
- **Countable-tasks:** This functionality will allow for tasks that can be performed multiple times a day, with each instance being tracked. The system will increment a counter for the task each time it's logged within a 24-hour period. This will likely require database schema modifications to store the counts and timestamps.

## Completion of `streamlit-app-manager` Project

The remaining tasks (15-18) from the original `streamlit-app-manager` project will be completed to finalize the system. This includes:
- Integrating app management into the settings UI.
- Implementing a programmatic API for external integration.
- Building a comprehensive test suite.
- Finalizing the integration of all components.
