# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Persistent Agents feature extends the existing Daily Engine with AI-powered agents that continuously monitor and manage critical life guardrails. These agents integrate seamlessly into the Daily Engine interface, surfacing alerts, recommendations, and status updates within the user's daily workflow to ensure that major financial, insurance, and property-related aspects of life are functioning correctly.

Rather than requiring a separate system, persistent agents appear contextually within the Daily Engine dashboard, providing proactive notifications and actionable insights as part of the user's regular daily management routine. This integration ensures that critical financial guardrails are monitored without adding complexity to the user's workflow.
