HISTORY OF USS TANG (SS 306)

USS TANG, in her short but brilliant career identified
herself as one of the U.S. Navy's fightingest ships. In five war
patrols in enemy controlled waters the TANG sank about 100,000
tons of Japanese shipping, rescued twenty-two Naval aviators, and
conducted her patrols in such a fashion that they will long remain
high in the annals of submarine warfare.

The results of TANG's dramatic battles proved to be of im-
measurable assistance toward the Allied conquest of the Pacific.
TANG exacted a terrific toll on enemy shipping at a time when the
enemy could ill afford to lose even a single unit.

It might be said that the TANG was predestined to be a success
Her keel was laid 15 January 1943 in the Navy Yard, Mare Island,
California. Seven months later she slid down the ways and entered
into her true element. Sponsor at the launching was Mrs. Antonio
S. Pitre, wife of Commander Pitre, who was then production officer
at the Navy Yard, Mare Island, California. Two months later, on
15 October 1943, TANG was commissioned, a full-fledged modern sub-
marine in the U.S. Navy.

Lieutenant Commander Richard O'Kane, USN, former Executive
Officer of the famed USS WAHOO took command. Lt. Murry B. Frazee,
Jr., went aboard as Executive Officer. Under the capable guidance
of these seasoned submariners, TANG was put through her paces in the
San Diego area and after eighteen days of intensive training exercises
left for Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 8 January 1944. Nineteen
more days of training followed and then TANG reported ready to wage
war against the enemy.

On 22 January 1944, TANG departed from Pearl on her first war
patrol. The patrol was conducted in the Caroline and Marianas Island
Area and the early part of the patrol consisted of lifeguard duty
for downed planes in the vicinity of Wake and Truk. TANG, however,
was not called on for rescue services. Upon being released from
lifeguard duty, TANG went out in search of prey.

Early in the morning on 17 February, a convoy of two freighters
with heavy escort of a destroyer and five smaller vessels was con-
tacted by radar. TANG tracked the convoy, determined its course
and speed, then went in for an attack. When nearly ahead, the star-
board flanking escort suddenly appeared at 7000 yards closing.


================================================================================

-2- USS TANG (SS 306)

TANG was forced down, deep; and five depth charges were dropped
in a half-hearted attack and the escort continued on. Fifteen minutes
later TANG resumed the approach at periscope depth in spite of addi-
tional charges being dropped at random by the escorts. The
range closed to 1500 yards and TANG cut loose with a salvo of four
torpedoes at the nearest freighter. Three hits blasted him solidly
and Commander O'Kane calmly watched through the periscope as it sank
by the stern amidst milling escorts. Thus did the terrific TANG
draw her first blood.

TANG cleared the area at deep submergence undetected. An
attempt was made to again get ahead of the convoy for a dawn attack,
but the remaining freighter passed out of range under cover of air
escort.

During the night of 22 February, just five days later, two
surface attacks were made on a convoy of three freighters with a
destroyer and three smaller escorts. After tracking him solidly
for half an hour, TANG maneuvered into a firing position on the
port bow of one of the freighters, about 4000 yards from the nearest
escort. An unpredicted zig required a "dipsy doodle" to maintain an
ideal firing position, but the freighter came on nicely, and with a
range of 1500 yards and TANG dead in the water and holding her
breath, she hit the freighter hit it with four torpedoes spread
over her length. The enemy ship literally disintegrated under four
hits and sank before TANG had completed ninety degrees of her turn
to evade. One of the escorts guessed right and began to close in on
TANG, but she seemed to find a couple of extra knots in her engines
and left the escort behind in very short order.

Another approach was made on the convoy. This time the leading
escort of what was later determined to be a Jap submarine tender,
conveniently moved way out ahead of the vessel. TANG succeeded in
sneaking into the position formerly occupied by the escort on the
port bow of the sub tender. Then, TANG stopped, waited, and at the
precise moment fired four torpedoes. The first two were beautiful
hits in her stern and just aft of the stack, but the third torpedo
hit forward of his bridge was terrific! The
enemy ship was twisted, lifted from the water as you would flip a
spoon on end, and then commenced belching flame as she sank. TANG
was shaken far worse than by any depth charge remembered. A quick
check-up, as soon as the crews' jaws came off their chests, showed no
serious damage done. During the following day the remnants of the
convoy could not be found.

About an hour before noon, two days later, a tanker, a freighter
and a destroyer were sighted. Effort to gain satisfactory position
for a periscope attack was unsuccessful because of rain squalls
and the wide zig-zagging of the targets.


================================================================================

-3- USS TANG (SS 306)

Contact was maintained and a night surface attack with four
torpedoes resulted in three good hits which destroyed the freighter.
The tanker opened fire fore and aft immediately, while the des-
troyer, then nearly 3000 yards away, closed the scene rapidly,
spraying shells in every direction. Contact with the destroyer
was maintained and position gained for a dawn attack
submerged. The decks of the tanker were covered with lookouts as
three of the four torpedoes fired blasted into the ship. The ex-
plosion was wonderful, throwing Japs and debris above the belching
smoke. She sank by the stern in four minutes, and TANG went to deep
submergence as the depth charges started pouring down.

The final attack was made after moonset on 22 February, after
a late afternoon contact had been made and the enemy tracked. A
transport, a freighter and four escorts made up the convoy. TANG
maneuvered into position on the wildly zig-zagging transport and
fired four torpedoes. All missed astern, however, as she speeded up.

TANG thus concluded her first war patrol, returning because all
of her torpedoes had been expended. Sixteen hits out of twenty-four
torpedoes fired shows the excellence of TANG's fire control party.

After a normal refit on Midway Island, TANG, on 16 March 1944,
departed on her second war patrol which was conducted in the areas
northwest of Palau, east of Davao, and in the vicinity of Truk.

Of five surface craft contacts, three were small patrol craft
and were evaded, one was an RO-class submarine which dived at a range
of 3000 yards on appearance of U.S. aircraft, and one smoke contact
of two ships. It was impossible to close this contact because of a
combination of air screen attacks, proximity to shoal water on Grey
Feather Bank and operation orders to take a lifeguard station.

Although disappointing that no shipping loss was incurred by
the enemy, the second war patrol of TANG was outstanding as its
first. By virtue of the remarkable cooperation with aircraft of
the U.S. striking force attacking Truk, willingness to proceed from
point to point within gun range of shore batteries in order to rescue
expeditiously, personnel of downed aircraft, and seizing the initia-
tive by bombarding known gun emplacements when passing Ollan Island,
twenty-two U.S. Naval aviation personnel were rescued from life boats
attributable in part to the scarcity of targets was attributable in part
to the presence of a heavy U.S. Task force in the Western Pacific.

On 6 May with twenty-two extra personnel aboard, and TANG's
relief in the area, the sub departed for Pearl Harbor, arriving there
May 15. This concluded TANG's second war patrol.

June 3, 1944, marked the beginning of the third war patrol for
USS TANG. Departing from Pearl Harbor after a normal refit, TANG
conducted her patrol in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea Areas.


================================================================================

-4- USS TANG

The first contact of this patrol occurred on the night of 24
June. TANG, on the surface, tore into a convoy of six large ships
with at least sixteen escorts, and with six torpedoes (three at
each) sank a 7500 ton freighter and a 10,000 ton tanker.

Lady Luck again gave TANG the nod five days later. Just prior
to noon while patrolling submerged, an unescorted medium freighter
was sighted on a course which prevented TANG from reaching a firing
position. TANG turned away, surfaced, made an end around and four
hours later, submerged and fired two torpedoes at the vessel. Both
missed. Depth charges were dropped on TANG and she had to lay low
for awhile. TANG surfaced and chased for an hour before regaining
contact, again made an end around and at 750 yards range loosed
one "feeler". This torpedo broke the ship in two and
it sank under the eyes of the TANG's crew.

TANG's next quarry was sighted in the morning while she was still
surfaced. It proved to be a 4000 ton medium freighter and a 2000
ton escort freighter. Submerging for a periscope attack, TANG
fired two torpedoes at the escort freighter. One hit and the ship
went down in just 2 minutes 20 seconds. The other freighter
reversed course and TANG trailed submerged until dusk when she
surfaced, ran up ahead of the freighter, submerged and at 500 yards
range loosed two torpedoes. One hit was all that was necessary.
The manner in which the ship blew up indicated a cargo of munitions.

The Fourth of July was celebrated with five works in the
traditional manner. At dawn TANG made an end around on the masts of
a ship and dove one hour later to continue the approach on what
developed into a 16,000 ton seaplane tender. With rapidly shoaling
water and the keel about to scrape the bottom, TANG backed down
and fired three torpedoes. Two hits sank this ship and TANG sur-
faced to clear the area in the midst of 34 fishing boats with about
50 survivors thrashing around in the water.

In the late afternoon of the same day, 4 July, smoke was sighted
and closed until finally the ship was sighted. After tracking to
determine his zig-zag plan, a submerged approach resulted in the
firing of two of TANG's torpedoes. One hit sank this ship. TANG
then surfaced to pick up a survivor. It was necessary to snake one
of two large overturned lifeboats along side with grapnels, and
threaten with tommy gun bursts to convince the visible sur-
vivor to come on board.

The following night under a beautiful full moon TANG made a
submerged approach on a medium freighter. Loosing her last two
torpedoes, both of which found their mark, TANG finished off her
eighth ship on the patrol. Midway Island was reached on 14 July,
ending the third war patrol.

-5- USS TANG

This, the third consecutive outstanding patrol
TANG, was characterized by the same aggressive, determined and
efficient fighting spirit that was so noticeable in her first and
second patrols. To her enviable record of sinking five ships on her
first patrol and the efficient rescuing of twenty-two Naval aviators
on her second patrol, TANG added eight more ships sunk on this patrol.

In recognition for the excellent performances of TANG on her
first three war patrols, she was awarded her first Presidential Unit
Citation.

Text of the citation follows:

"For outstanding performance in combat and
distinguished service during her First, Second
and Third War Patrols in Japanese-controlled
waters. Operating boldly in defiance of alert
hostile air patrols in dangerous areas far from
her home base, the USS TANG struck devastating
blows at Japanese combatant units and heavily es-
corted convoys in the Pacific despite unfavorable
opportunity, sinking thousands of tons of
valuable enemy shipping during her first and third
war patrols. Rendering gallant lifeguard service
during air strikes against enemy-held atolls by
United States Forces, the TANG braved the treacher-
ous reefs off the coast of a powerfully fortified
stronghold to rescue twenty-two Naval aviators
in seven pick-ups, completing this perilous mission
within close range of hostile shore batteries. The
brilliant and heroic achievements of this vessel
reflect the highest credit upon the courage, sea-
manship and determination of her officers and men
and enhance the fine traditions of the United States
Naval Service."

The fourth war patrol of TANG was conducted off the coast of
Honshu in the Japanese Empire Waters.

TANG's first kill occurred on this patrol when she attained a
position on the beam of two freighters in column accompanied by a gun
boat and a smaller escort. Three torpedoes were fired at the first
ship and a similar salvo at the second ship. After a quick look
which showed the gun boat proceeding rapidly and closely across the
stern, one hit was observed amidships in the first target resulting
in a disintegrating explosion. Two timed hits were heard in the
second target as TANG took evasive action and she was subjected to a
"tooth-shaking" depth charge attack.


================================================================================

================================================================================

-6- USS TANG

TANG's next action was a surface battle. A patrol yacht was
attacked with the 4" gun. Eight hits were scored, demolishing the
deck house aft and exploding in the patrol boats' sides and upper
works.

Next, a patrol vessel of about 1500 tons was found at anchor.
The night was black. This vessel was, however, recognized as one
which had previously depth-charged TANG. Two torpedoes from the
stern tubes produced no results so bow tubes were brought to bear
and two more torpedoes fired. One of these hit the point of aim
and the target sank after a spectacular explosion. TANG had her
revenge.

August 23 was another lucky day for the terrific TANG. A large
transport accompanied by a PC or DE ahead, an SC on this bow, and an
LST and PC astern, was sighted. A beautiful approach put TANG in
position 800 yards abeam and three torpedoes fired resulted in two
hits and in the sinking of this valuable loaded transport.

Shortly thereafter, from a position inshore of a modern diesel
tanker proceeding close to the beach, three torpedoes were fired from
the stern tubes. Down went the tanker to the bottom of the sea!

With all torpedoes expended, TANG steamed back to Pearl Harbor
to rest her crew and overhaul her equipment.

TANG's brilliant fifth patrol began on 27 September and ended
24 October. This is a saga of one of the greatest submarine cruises
of all times, the fifth and last patrol of a fighting ship.

On 11 October 1944, shortly after entering her area in Formosa
Straits, TANG started off this auspicious patrol by launching two
skillfully planned and smartly conducted torpedo attacks which
resulted in the sinking of two heavily laden freighters. On 23
October after a thorough analysis of all shipping routes, TANG made
contact on a large heavily-escorted convoy composed of three large
tankers, a large transport loaded with troops and a large freighter.

The Commanding Officer took TANG into the middle of the con-
voy on the surface and delivered a brilliantly conceived torpedo
attack which resulted in devastating hits on all three of these
valuable tankers. Amid the resulting pandemonium, TANG swung and
fired at the freighter when it was noticed that the transport, angry
for revenge, was fast bearing down on the TANG with intentions of
ramming. Emergency speed and hard left rudder saved the sub from
hitting the on-rushing transport by seconds.

TANG was now boxed in with three blazing, sinking tankers on
one side and the freighter, transport and several destroyers coming
in from the other side. Despite a deadly hail of bullets and shells
coming from all directions, Commander O'Kane launched another torpedo
attack which blew the freighter and transport out of the water.


================================================================================

================================================================================

-7- USS TANG
Then, with no torpedoes in the tubes TANG broke through the escorts
to reload. In the incredibly short time of ten minutes of breath-
taking action, TANG sank an entire enemy convoy.

Twenty-four hours later, contact was again made with the enemy,
this time with another heavily-loaded, heavily-escorted convoy steam-
ing to support the Leyte Campaign. The tankers all carried planes
piled high on their decks and even the bows and sterns of the
transports were piled high with plane crates jammed in with the troops. Again, TANG
maneuvered into the formation and launched four torpedoes, two
at a transport and two at a tanker. At a range of less than 1000
yards all torpedoes hit as planned with a series of violent explosions.

TANG's position was revealed to the enemy in the light of the
burning, exploding ships and they were quick to act against the sub-
marine which had caused so much damage among their ranks. With
debris flying high in the air and escorts firing from all sides,
TANG was again completely boxed in by the enemy. A large transport
and a tanker were off the stern, a destroyer was charging in at high
speed from one side, two or more destroyer escorts were coming in
from the other side, and three burning sinking ships were directly
off the bow. Full speed ahead was rung up and TANG charged the
enemy. A salvo of three torpedoes was fired and they found their
mark with great devastation; the first hit the tanker with its
valuable cargo of aviation gasoline sky-high; the second hit
the transport and blasted out her submarine destroying intentions with a
mighty roar which rocked TANG from stem to stern.

TANG now had but two torpedoes left. Moving in on the crippled
transport, the last two were fired. The first torpedo ran straight
and true to the target. The second torpedo, however, ran erratically
in a circular run after leaving the tube. Emergency speed
was called for but twenty seconds after firing, the malfunctioning
torpedo hit the stern of TANG.

The Commanding Officer and several members of the crew were
blown off the bridge by the explosion and the TANG sank immediately.
Some other members of the crew also escaped and in all, nine men were
captured by the Japanese and liberated by U.S. Forces after the war
was over.

Though the short but illustrious career of the fighting TANG
was stilled forever by an unavoidable act of fate, this outstanding
submarine, led by its courageous captain, Commander Richard H. O'Kane,
succeeded in exacting a monumental toll among the enemy. In recogni-
tion of the results of TANG's fourth and fifth war patrols she was
awarded a second Presidential Unit Citation.


================================================================================
PAGE 10
================================================================================

-8- USS TANG

Text of the citation follows:
"For extraordinary heroism in action during her Fourth
War Patrol against enemy Japanese shipping in the Honshu
Area from July 31 to September 3, 1944, and her Fifth War
Patrol in Formosa Straits, September 27 to October 24, 1944.
Boldly searching out the enemy through perilous coastline
shoal waters to establish contact with a large hostile convoy,
the USS TANG penetrated a heavy escort screen on to launch a
series of smashing torpedo attacks and sink five Japanese
ships totaling 22,500 tons. With every surface unit vital
to the enemy during accelerated hostilities pointing toward
the crucial battle for Leyte Gulf, the TANG daringly challeng-
ed two large, well armed, heavily escorted convoys bound for
the Philippines with reinforcements and supplies. Operating
without support and in heroic defiance of severe counter-
measures, she attacked relentlessly from all sides, waging
furious battle against terrific odds and climaxing her
aggressive Fifth Patrol by sending every ship of both
convoys to the bottom. A seaworthy, fighting ship, handled
brilliantly by her gallant officers and men, the TANG pound-
ed out her previous distinguished record of achievement by her
crushing blows against the enemy's power to wage war, there-
materially furthering the vital operations to control the
Pacific and upholding the highest traditions of the United
States Naval Service."

TANG (SS 306)

TANG, under Cdr. R. H. O'Kane, set out from Pearl
Harbor on 24 September 1944, to begin her fifth war
patrol. On 27 September she topped off with fuel at
Midway and left there the same day, heading for an
area between the northwest coast of Formosa, and the
China Coast.

The story of TANG's sinking comes from the report
of her surviving Commanding Officer. A night surface
attack was launched on 24 October 1944 against a trans-
port which had previously been stopped in an earlier
attack. The first torpedo was fired, and when it was
observed to be running true, the second and last was
fired. It curved sharply to the left, broached, por-
poised and circled. Emergency speed was called for
and the rudder was thrown over. These measures re-
sulted only in the torpedo striking the stern of TANG,
rather than amidships.

The explosion was violent, and people as far forward
as the control room received broken limbs. The ship
went down by the stern with the after three compart-
ments flooded. Of the nine officers and men on the
bridge, three were able to swim through the night until
picked up eight hours later. One officer escaped from
the flooded conning tower, and was rescued with the
others.

In order to reach her area, TANG had to pass through
narrow waters known to be heavily patrolled by the
enemy. A large area stretching northeast from For-
mosa was known to be mined by the enemy, and O'Kane
was given the choice of making the passage north of
Formosa alone, or joining a coordinated attack group
(SILVERSIDES, TRIGGER, SALMON, under Commander
Coye in SILVERSIDES) which was to patrol off north-
east Formosa, and making the passage with them.
TANG chose to make the passage alone and these ves-
sels never heard from TANG, nor did any base, after
she left Midway.

R. H. O'Kane

The submarine came to rest on the bottom at 180
feet, and the men in her crowded forward as the after
compartments flooded. Publications were burned, and
all assembled to the forward room to escape. The es-
cape was delayed by a Japanese patrol, which dropped
[UNCLEAR: a few]


================================================================================
PAGE 12
================================================================================

charges, and started an electrical fire in the forward
battery. Thirteen men escaped from the forward room,
and by the time the last made his exit, the heat from
the fire was so intense that the paint on the bulkhead
was scorching, melting, and running down. Of the 13
men who escaped, only eight reached the surface, and
of these but five were able to swim until rescued.

When the nine survivors were picked up by a de-
stroyer escort, there were victims of TANG's previous
sinkings on board, and they inflicted tortures on the
men from TANG. With great humanity, O'Kane states,
"When we realized that our clubbings and kickings were
being administered by the burned, mutilated survivors
of our own handiwork, we found we could take it with
less prejudice."

The nine captives were retained by the Japanese in
prison camps until the end of the war, and were treated
by them in typical fashion. The loss of TANG by her
own torpedo, the last one fired on the most successful
patrol ever made by a U. S. submarine, was a stroke
of singular misfortune. She is credited with having
sunk 13 vessels for 107,324 tons of enemy shipping on
this patrol, and her Commanding Officer has been
awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

On her last patrol TANG fired twenty-four torpedoes
in four attacks. Twenty-two torpedoes found their mark
in enemy ships, sinking 13 of the 13; one missed, and
the last torpedo, fired after a careful checkover, sank
TANG. This vessel was awarded the Presidential Unit
Citation twice during her career. Commander O'Kane
has been called the Submarine Force's most outstanding
officer; he served as Executive Officer of the very suc-
cessful WAHOO before taking command of TANG.

In her five patrols, TANG is credited with sinking
31 ships, totalling 227,800 tons and damaging two for
4,100 tons. This record is unexcelled among American
submarines. In her first patrol, spending February
1944 west of Truk and Saipan, she sank three freighters,
a large tanker and a submarine tender. TANG's sec-
ond patrol was in the area west of Palau, east of Davao
and at Truk. She made no ship contacts worthy of at-
tack, but at the latter island she rescued twenty-two
Navy airmen during a carrier based strike at Truk on
30 April-1 May 1944. This vessel's third patrol was
in the East China and Yellow Seas. Here she sank six
freighters, an aircraft transport, and a large tanker.
She covered the waters along the southern coast of
Honshu in August 1944. She sank a freighter, a large
transport, a tanker and two patrol craft, while she dam-
aged another freighter and small craft.

ing false start for assigned area on the thirty-first. De-
parted from assigned station to patrol southwest of the island
whenever circumstances of special mission permitted, and
closed the island daily to insure that no shipping had passed
by our seventeen foot periscope or radar searches.
The six air strikes on the thirtieth and fifth were
carried out without incident. Except for dawn searchlight dis-
plays, the only activity observed during the week was ineffect-
ual searching after the first air attack by one or two planes
dropping flares sporadically. Observation from within three
miles did not disclose any damage to shore installation by
the first air attack.

Feb 6-7 (-12)

Upon release from lifeguard duty shortly after mid-
night, proceeded at fifteen knots to newly assigned station
north of TRUK.
At 1345 on the seventh dived for twenty minutes and
avoided an unidentified plane. Slowed to eleven knots at mid-
night.

Feb 8 (-11)

Sighted U.S.S. GUARDFISH at 1315 and avoided on the
surface, entered assigned area at 1500 and proceeded toward
the western boundary to patrol the TRUK-EMPIRE routes.

new patrol station south of ULUL Island. At 1204 on the four-
teenth and at 0925 and 1123 on the fifteenth two plane contacts
on the SD at 20, 24, and 28 miles. These were tracked out to
almost 35 miles.

                                        ATT.CK # 1

          At 0025 on the morning of the seventeenth, sighted
a convoy on the SJ bearing 305T distance 31000 yards. It was
tracked at eight and one-half knots on base course 100°,
directly into the rising half moon, and zig-zagging forty degrees
every ten to fourteen minutes. As viewed on the radar, excluding
what later was believed to be a destroyed ship, some-
what smaller one, later believed to be a destroyed, a small
escort close ahead, two more escorts on either beam, and two
more wide flanking patrols.
          At 0219, when nearly ahead, with range to convoy
15000 yards, the starboard flanking escort suddenly appeared
at 7000 yards closing at four knots. We were forced down, deep,
and given five depth charges, but his attack was half hearted
and we were able to return to radar depth fifteen minutes after
he passed by. The convoy was still 9000 yards away and coming
on nicely. Our approach from here in was quite routine, except
for additional depth charges and patrolling escorts. Went back

to periscope depth at 4000 yards, watched the leading escort
cross conveniently to the opposite bow, the port escort cross-
ing our bow, and at 0335 fired a spread of four straight stern
shots at the near AK, range 1500, 80 port track, speed 8½.
The first three hit their points of aim in the screws, and the
fourth hit amidships at the midship superstructure. Watched
the freighter sinking by the stern amidst milling escorts.
She was a split superstructure freighter, with details similar
to the MANSEI MARU, low in the water, with a bulky deck load.
When she had sunk we went to our favorite depth
below the 375 foot gradient and cleared the area. Some add-
itional depth charging followed, but none close, and we were
able to search with radar and surface at 0500.

Feb 16-17 (-10)

There were still ships in sight on the radar with
one large escorted one at 14000 yards, which we tracked on
course 300, speed seven knots. During the next forty minutes
we pushed our TVG's and MEP's in charging and getting ahead
of the freighter, but he evidently had been on a northerly
leg of a wandering zig, for during the submerged approach in
the next six hours he presented angles of 50 starboard to 150
port. Our best sustained speed closed the range to 6000 yards
at one time, but he then drew slowly away and disappeared to-
ward the BURRFISH who evidently made contact with him. The
U.S.S. SHIO destroyer, a CHIDORI, a PC type escort, and a plane
which were escorting him precluded an end-round, so proceeded
submerged to our assigned position for the attack on TRUK. The
freighter, in ballast, was a typical goalpost, funnel, goal-
poster with composite superstructure.

Feb 18-19 (-10)

Patrolling on the surface in the vicinity of assign-
ed position 12 miles bearing 194° from ULUL. As our SJ gave
fair contact on this 85 foot island at 33000 yards, remained
about four miles south of assigned position out of sight of
the island. Numerous SD contacts, only one of which was closer
than the range to the island, and most of which disappeared
at the distance to the island, indicated considerable patrol
or plane escort activity from ULUL. We dove for a half hour
and apparently avoided detection by the one plane that did
close our station inside fifteen miles.

Feb 20-21 (-10)

Shortly after dawn on the twentieth proceeded to-
ward new station at SAIPAN, running at one engine speed. Dur-

ing the forenoon numerous SD contacts from 20 to 28 miles in-
dicated air activity and perhaps a plane escort for a convoy.
Searches ten miles either side of our track revealed nothing.
At 0930 the morning of the twenty-first, a half hour
after our trim dive, commenced submerging for an enemy patrol
planes. We thought we were undetected by the first one, sighted
at twelve miles, but four dives later in as many hours, with
lookouts reporting planes in different sectors and SD contacts
closing, dived for the rest of the day.

Feb 22 (-10)

Patrolled submerged ten miles southwest of AGUIJ.N
Island, where we would be able to intercept traffic from SAIP.N
to GU.M passing north or south of TINIAN. Sighted one surface
patrol on the SJ on approaching this spot and avoided submerged
after daylight. Bombers continuously passed close over us dur-
ing the day. At dusk we surfaced to observe considerable search
light signalling in vicinity of TANAPAG harbor, so headed north
at two engine speed to intercept any escaping ships. Our usual
SJ performance was cut down by surrounding rain squalls. Bare-
ly indicating the island at 35 miles, but at 2200 the SJ sight-
ed our first ship at 14000 yards. Closed and tracked and soon
had five ships in sight on the radar, with another group some-
times visible to the north. The persistent rain squalls were
both for and against us at this time, for they changed the
relative size of the pips and made visual investigation of the
enemy inside 3500 yards essential in selecting suitable targets.

ATTACK # 2

Following two such approaches on pa-
a KENYO MARU type AK with escorts on starboard bow and quarter.
After tracking this freighter zigging on course 255T for an
other half hour, moved into position on his port bow, 4000 yds
from his nearest escort. An unpredicted zig required a "dipsy
doodle" to maintain an ideal firing position, but he came on
track, and at 2349, with range 1500, 90 port track, the TANG
used in the water and holding her breath, let him have four
torpedoes spread his length from aft forward by constant TBT
bearings. The enemy literally disintegrated under four hits
and sank before we had completed ninety degrees of our turn to
evade. One escort guessed right and closed to 3000 yards, but
these boats always seem to find a couple of extra knots for
such occasions, and we made a sandblower out of him.

ATTACK # 3
We still had difficulty in identifying the enemy
on the radar, and our next approach, in spite of sound, de-
veloped into a destroyer at 3500 yards, with TANG backing
down 1200 yards off her track. Both sea and visibility pre-
cluded anything but a defensive attack on such a ship, so
pulled clear with minimum range 2900 yards. There followed
one more approach, a bit more cautious, on what appeared to
be a submarine, before we located what was apparently a
naval auxiliary, definitely of the ARIMASAN MARU class. As
her escort conveniently moved out to 800 yards ahead, we
moved into position on her port bow, stopped, and
then pointed at her with another nice rain squall for a
background. As she came on her guns were plainly visible
forward and then aft. At 0120, with range 1400, and 90 port track
and gyro around zero, let her have four torpedoes spread
her length from aft forward. The first two were beautiful
hits in her stern and just aft of the stack, but the detona-
tion as the third torpedo hit forward of his bridge was
terrific. The enemy ship was twisted, lifted from the water
as you would flip a spoon on end, and then commenced belch-
ing flame as she sank. The TANG was shaken for a quick check,
by any depth charge we could remember, but a quick check,
as soon as our jaws came off our chests, showed no damage
except that the outer door gasket of number five tube, which
was just being secured, blew out of its groove. We considered
this lightly at the time.
As is usually the case when you hit first, the
escorts were befuddled and evasion was simplified. It is
considered that this ship was either a submarine or destroyer
tender, or an ammunition ship.
Further searches and one more approach disclosed
only three patrol type vessels, so commenced a retiring
covering possible positions of the northern enemy
group, an all day search on the surface to north and then
retiring to the west disclosed nothing.

Feb 24 (-10)

Patrolled on the surface, 150 miles west of SAIPAN
with high periscope and radar when
searching with high periscope and radar when horizon was
fuzzy. At 1109 sighted smoke bearing 015T and immediately
picked up two targets on the SJ at 23000 and 24000 yards.
With a clearing horizon the enemy was shortly identified as
a freighter, large tanker, and destroyer. Tracking showed
them on course 270, so we moved out to maximum radar range
to avoid detection and gained position ahead for a submerged

approach. Contact was suddenly lost, but a half hour run
at full power toward their last true bearing located them
again, this time on base course 165T.

Gathering rain squalls made it more apparent that
we would do well to maintain contact with the enemy dur-
ing the remainder of the day, and that the only possibility
of destroying both ships lay in night, or night and dawn
attacks. The remainder of the day became more trying with
the enemy employing wide zigs and all contact being lost
in extremely heavy passing squalls. Sometimes he would
emerge on a new course, sometimes on the same, but in most
cases it was necessary for us to go in after him at full
power, and then retire to avoid detection.

ATTACK # 4

At sunset the destroyer came into a clear spot,
sent several signals on a large searchlight to his convoy,
lined them up with tanker astern, and started off on course
west. As soon as they had faded in the dusk we closed from
north at full power to find them on our port bow headed
east toward SAIPAN. The enemy zigs were of the wildest sort,
sometimes actually backtracking, but their very wildness
was his undoing, for after two hours of tracking and two
approaches on their quarters, with our outer doors
open for firing on four different occasions, the freighter,
a T.MUTSU or KI MRU class ship, made one of his super right
zigs across our bow. At 2230, when the range was 1400, 95
yard track, gyros around zero, we cold-cocked him with
the first three of our usual four torpedoes, spread along
his length by constant TBT bearings. The ship blew up in a
beautiful fireworks, sank before we had completed
our turn to evade. The tanker opened fire for a while,
while the destroyer, then nearly 3000 yards
away, closed the scene rapidly, spraying shells in every
direction, and firing with every possible means at us.
After helping out any possible survivors with
twelve depth charges, she rejoined the tanker. During the
first flurry some tracer shells came within a thousand yards
of us, but obviously just by chance.

The destroyer now stayed so close to the tanker
for several hours we could distinguish only one ship
on the radar most of the time, from our position
as on his port beam. The sporadic gun firing and
occasional depth charges convinced us on these occasions
that both were still there.

They continued on the same base course, but settled
down to moderate zigs. Before dawn we were in posi-
tion, ten thousand yards ahead and still eighty miles
west of SAIPAN. Only a daylight change of base course
could prevent our attack.

ATTACK # 5

At 0548, with skies gray in the east, sub-
merged to radar depth, took a last check at range 7000
yards, then started a submerged approach to close an
ASASHIO type destroyer patrolling
ahead. As we were then 1200 yards from the
track, turned and paralleled his base course. At
2000 yards the destroyer gave us some bad moments by
crossing to our bow for the second time, pointing directly
at our position. But in his attempt to prevent a repeti-
tion of his mistake of the night before, he turned right,
passed down the tanker's starboard side to the quarter.
He was absolutely dwarfed by the length of the loaded
tanker, whose details were now plainly visible. She was
painted slate gray, comparable only to our CIMARRON class,
but with bridge and foremast well forward, just behind
a bulging bow, which mounted an estimated six inch gun.
Her mainmast was close against her after superstructure
which was topped by an extremely large short stack. Her
only gun above her bulging cruiser stern, was similar
to the one forward. There is no similar vessel in any of
the identification books aboard. All vantage points
including guns, bridge, bridge overhead, and rails, were
manned with an estimated 150 uniformed lookouts on our
side alone.

A twenty degree zig toward put us a little close
to the track, but as we had already commenced our turn
away for a stern shot, we were far from inconvenienced.
At 0639, with the escort just crossing the tanker's stern
to the far side, fired four torpedoes by sound bearing
range 500 yards, 90 starboard track, gyro
180°, at the forward end of his after superstructure
stack, at the forward and of his after superstructure,
and under his bridge. The explosions were wonderful, throw-
ing caps and other debris above the belching smoke. He
sank by the stern in four minutes, and then we went deep
and avoided. The depth charges started a minute later,
but were never close.

Our blown torpedo tube gasket, which we con-
sidered lightly on the 23rd, now caused trouble, for the
inner door gasket rolled out of its groove under the
pressure of water, and pumps would not keep up with the
safety tank nearly dry, regained good control at
80 feet and avoided for the rest of the day at this depth,
with occasional looks at 60 feet when our destroyer came
close. He was persistent, probably hearing our pumps
one of which had to be run continuously, and purred
on, too by thoughts of a slit belly if he failed. Dark
finally came after our longest day, and a new inner door
gasket was installed without much trouble after surface-
ing. T shaped gaskets, similar to those just installed
in hatches, should obviously be installed in inaccessible
torpedo tube outer doors at the first practical date.
With four forward torpedoes left, proceeded
northward toward the lower BONINS, our new patrol area.

Feb 26 (-10)

ATTACK # 6

Patrolled on the surface, proceeding to new
area. At 1545, when about 180 miles northwest of SAIPAN,
sighted smoke which quickly developed into a four ship
convoy. Tracked them on course 150 until dark, identify-
ing one as a two-stacker. Remained outside of 10000 yards
until moonset, when radar tracking showed them to be
worm turning, on base course east. The rear ship of the
convoy was small with a patrolling escort astern that
we could not see at 3000 yards, so we found her shortly,
searching for our two stacker. We found her shortly,
astern of the leading freighter, and just ahead of a
small unidentified vessel.
Escorts on either bow of the leading freighter
offered no difficulty in closing the two stacker from
the blank. She was now tracked on straight course 090.
We watched her closely from 3000 yards before clos-
ing in to a firing position. A column zig brought the
leading freighter across our port bow, so twisted left,
steadied, and fired our usual spread of four torpedoes
covering the entire length of the two stacker as he came
by. Radar range 1600, gyros near zero, 100 starboard
track. All torpedoes, even the one fired at his bow,
apparently missed astern, as we failed to detect his in-
creasing speed as he resumed worm turning. Had a little
difficulty in evading the escorts as one challenged us
with a signal searchlight several times, which furthers our
suspicion that the lagging escort, which we could not see
at 3000 yards, was an enemy submarine.

U.S.S. TANG

(I) MINES AND MINE LAYING

None observed.

(J) ANTI-SUBMARINE MEASURES AND
EVASION TACTICS

Numerous escorts were encountered with every
contact, but their patrolling was unsystematic and sooner
or later left an opening for attack, generally on the
flank. It was possible to come up unbelievably close
on the quarter of an escort without being sighted, poor
stern or quarter lookouts on their part is indicated.
Their gunfire and depth charging was of the
wildest sort and most ineffectual, as always evasion
was easy when the enemy was hit first, and much simply-
fied by the PPI.

(K) MAJOR DEFECTS

None.

The only design weakness encountered is the
old type dove-tailed gasket in torpedo tube doors. Re-
placement of the outer door gasket is impossible except
in the calmest sea, and its failure immediately puts
a submarine to dangerously shallow depths. As hatch gas-
kets, which are readily accessable are now of the T type,
it seems evident that torpedo tube door gaskets should
be modified likewise as soon as practicable.

(L) RADIO

Both reception and transmission were satis-
factory.

(M) RADAR

Although requiring considerable checking and
attention by radar personnel, both SJ and SD worked re-
liably and were of great value.

(N) SOUND GEAR AND SOUND CONDITIONS.

Good.

May 15, 1944.

(A) PROLOGUE

Returned from first patrol March third and completed
refit on the eleventh. As no difficulties were expected or
experienced, post repair was combined with two day and one
night training period. Finished loading on the fifteenth, and
departed on second patrol at dawn March sixteenth.

(B) NARRATIVE

March 16 (12)

0655 Left Midway for Palau, proceeding at two engine speed.

March 17-22 (-12-11)

Enroute area conducting routine drills and dives.

March 23 (-11)

0512 Sighted trawler on patrol and avoided on the surface.
Our position, 150 miles east of PAGAN Island, indicates
that this vessel probably was a spotter, and not fish-
ing.
1235 Dived for half an hour on sighting an unidentified
plane.
1712 Dived until dusk to avoid being sighted while passing
between PAGAN and ALAMAGAN Islands. Delayed an hour to
insure peak radar operation while we had land contacts
available. In spite of the excellent wave meters and
other apparatus now provided for tuning this equip ent,
there is nothing like a good land contact to demonstrate
its proper operation. Even the experts concede this.

March 24 (-10)

0907 Changed course to north to intercept U.S.S. BARB's
convoy.
1406 Dived for thirty minutes to avoid a patrol type air-
craft.
1608 Dived for two SD contacts at ten miles.
1632 Surfaced and proceeded along reverse of expected convoy
track until dark, and then proceeded toward assigned
area west of PALAU, as our orders will not permit fur-
ther delay.

...enroute area.

March 27 (-9)

1651 Dived and avoided an unidentified aircraft.
2000 Entered area 10N, then proceeded to position sixty
     miles bearing 255° from TOAGLL MLUM-UI pass, as as-
     signed for strike on PALAU.

March 28 (-9)

     On assigned station. Conducted submerged patrol as
     ordered, but searching continuously with 17 feet of
     both periscopes, sound, and guarding 50 KC on the
     SD mast.

March 29 (-9)

1210 Patrolling submerged as on previous day.
1323 Sighted patrol type plane.
     Just prior to surfacing, sighted thin raked mast of a
     ship. Conducted submerged approach at six knots until
     dark but could not close it sufficiently to determine
     its identity.
1857 Surfaced, continued tracking, and took position ahead
     for moonlight submerged observation and possible fir-
     ing, although the "blurb" of the target at 7000 yards
     seemed very small.
1950 Almost simultaneous with lightning flashes which revealed
     the target to be a PC type patrol, six large planes in
     groups of two arrived on the scene. They had on both
     running lights and landing lights and proceeded with
     what appeared to be a routine submarine search. As we
     were in an unfortunate position ahead of the first PC,
     which was later joined by a second, it required two
     hours at periscope depth and finally deep submergence
     to get clear.

March 30 (-9)

     Conducted submerged patrol, searching with seventeen
     feet of periscopes.
     Heard a good explosion, followed by a second fifteen
     seconds later. As the horizon was absolutely clear,
1217 surfaced for a better look.
1227 Sighted three planes, believed friendly, simultaneous
1258 with radar contact at seven miles. Dived and continued
     submerged patrol.

March 31 (-9)

0721 Patrolled submerged on assigned station.
1700 Sighted bomber, fairly close.
2200 Sighted medium bomber on easterly course.
2232 Sighted two planes on the SD at about 16 miles which
     gathered us for half an hour as they conducted a
     search under the half moon. As they did not close inside
     eight miles, remained on the surface.

April 1 (-9)

0553 Sighted a large plane on the horizon, dived and com-
     menced usual high periscope submerged patrol for the
     day.

April 2 (-9)

0104 Sighted flash over horizon on bearing of PALAU, followed
     by apparent loom of searchlights.
0553 Commenced submerged high periscope patrol.
2000 Departed at one engine speed for newly assigned station
     120-150 miles east of DAVAO CITY, MINDANAO.

April 3 (-9)

0100 Passed to operational command of ComTaskFor Seventy-One.
0808 Dived for onehalf hour and apparently avoided detection
     by a patrol plane.
2400 Entered new area east of DAVAO GULF.

April 4 (-9)

0347 Patrolled on surface in center of assigned area, search-
     ing with both periscopes, sound to detect echo rang-
     ing and SJ during reduced visibility.
     Dived for three-quarters of an hour and apparently
     avoided detection by a plane sighted on SD at twelve
     miles.

April 5 (-9)

1042 Searched on surface as on previous day.
     Dived for forty minutes and apparently avoided detection
     by a plane sighted on the horizon.

April 6 (-9)

2100 Patrolling on surface.
     Departed area, proceeding east at five knots on the
     auxiliary engine to conserve fuel. Our number 4 BT
     could not be converted by Submarine Base, Midway,
     during the last refit.

April 7 (-9)

0752. Dived for twenty minutes and avoided plane sighted on
horizon, then proceeded toward former area at five knots,
searching as usual with everything we've got.
0900 Passed to operational command of ComTaskFor SEVENTH.

April 8 (-9)

Patrolling on the surface enroute newest area north
west of PALAU.
0900 Commenced passing through a field of oil drums which
continued throughout the day.
1500 SD radar out of commission on afternoon test. The radar
officer, radio technician, and leading radioman were
relieved of all other duties and commenced "round the
clock" repairs.

April 9 (-9)

0330 Sighted an unidentified plane which did not close, so
continued on the surface. Numerous oil drums were again
in sight all day.

April 10 (-9)

0058 Sighted plane on SD radar which closed to five miles
before opening.
0813 Dived for forty minutes for a plane on SD at 8 miles.
Apparently avoided detection due to overcast skys.
1017 Sighted single mast and deck house of an apparent PC
type patrol boat. Dived and attempted to close to
investigate, but height of eye range and change of bear-
ing, when next observed from forty feet, showed him on
a northeasterly course, at better than fifteen knots,
and out of reach. As we were then about fifty miles
from TOAGEL LUNGUI pass, and expecting shipping within a
day, continued on submerged to close the island undetected,
but searching with 17 feet of periscope. It was a long
haul from INDIMAO on the auxiliary engine, but other-
wise we would not have had sufficient fuel to complete
the patrol.

April 11 (-9)

Conducted submerged patrol ten miles west of NG.RUANGL
passage, with periodic high periscope searches. From
this position we would have been able to intercept
shipping through this passage or around VELASCO reef,
headed for TOAGEL LUNGUI, and at the same time been
able to spot and trail for night attack any traffic from
this latter pass. We considered this our first likely

"spot" in nearly four weeks of patrol.

April 12 (-9)

As the TRIGGER was delayed in entering her lower half
of area 10 N, patrolled submerged five miles of TOAGEL
LUNGUI passage, covering her area as well as our own.

April 13 (-9)

1220 Conducted submerged patrol between three and four miles
off TOAGEL LUNGUI.
Sighted four motored flying boat which apparently landed
in the lagoon. Repairs were completed to the SJ today,
and it worked with peak performance on surfacing. As we
have patrolled close in and enjoyed bright nights, it
is doubtful that any shipping slipped by us, especially
as TOAGEL LUNGUI pass would hardly be used at night,
unlighted.

April 14 (-9)

0154 Sighted U.S.S. TRIGGER on the SJ radar, as she crossed
our area. Closed her and made preliminary arrangements
for mutual assistance in covering this area, and estab-
lished sound communication for later use.
1400 Patrolled two miles off TOAGEL LUNGUI during forenoon.
As passing squalls developed into steady rain, surfaced,
moved out to five miles from the pass, and conducted
radar search. After dark, moved out to contact TRIGGER,
but SJ failure prevented early rendezvous.

April 15 (-9)

0011 Sighted U.S.S. TRIGGER, and sent over the following by
the tin can-line throwing gun method: (1) All new infor-
mation we have concerning this area. (2) Our ideas for
its most effective coverage by two submarines. (3) A
duplicate copy of coordinated attack doctrine and signals,
for possible use. Received compatable ideas for co-
ordinated patrol, and a report of TRIGGER's
her damage, for delivery to ComSubPac.
TOAGEL LUNGUI before dawn and conducted submerged patrol
three to four miles off pass during the day.
1056 Sighted four engine flying boat.
1638 Sighted four engine bomber.
2152 Made rendezvous with TRIGGER who sent a rubber boat to
TANG. Supplied her with compressor valves and cages,
radar tubes, and our spare battery blower motor to use
as a sound training motor.

Observations lead us to believe that it will remain
stagnant for some time and that our route to TRUK
will offer better chance of contact.

April 23 (-9)

1840 Enroute TRUK at one engine speed, searching with both
periscopes, sound to detect echo ranging, and SJ radar
during passing squalls.
In anticipation of bombarding the phosphorite refinery
on FAIS Island the following evening, commenced firing
seven rounds to determine the limit of twilight
for accurate pointing and training, and to estab-
lish the ballistic to make the sight bar range equal
radar range to the splashes.

April 24 (-9)

0600 As we were sufficiently ahead of schedule, changed
course to close FAIS Island, forty miles north of our
track.
1000 Dived fifteen miles from the island and closed at four
knots. As we were aware of the reported gun emplace-
ments, established the bearing line between gun
tower and refinery as 123° T, then proceeded around the
island for bombardment by indirect fire. Surfaced in
evening twilight with lookout tower, our point of aim,
1828 bearing 303° T, range 7300 yards, and commenced firing
33 rounds of four inch. To insure crossing the refinery,
employed a rocking ladder of 200 and then 100 yard
steps, and applied deflection spots as previously com-
puted to include other structures in the installation.
Though the results were not discernable, the shell
detonations were nicely visible at the bottom of the
ladders and the target area was crossed several times.
As expected, their guns, placed to protect the in-
stallation on the west side of the island, were unable
to return any fire.
1845 Set course for new lifeguard station off TRUK at one
engine speed.

April 25-26 (-10)

Enroute TRUK.

April 27 (-10)

0859 Dived for a six mile SD contact simultaneous with high
periscope sighting of smoke to the southwest near
PITCHFIELD BAY. On return to periscope depth eight
minutes later, sighted the plane going away, and then

the smoke from fifty feet. There wer two patches
tracked on a westerly course at about ten knots. Our
attempts to "end around" before the enemy might reach
GREATER BANK were frustrated by the air coverage
which drove us down five times before the enemy, the last
with a "swish", perhaps of a dud bomb, and a rattle
of machine gun bullets. Continued trailing for three
more hours, but sighted no more smoke. The enemy was
now an hour on the bank, and a hundred miles from
deep water. We assured us with no assurance that we could
guess where he would again strike deep water. Faced with this,
and the problem of reaching our lifeguard station by
the following day, regretfully set course for TRUK.

April 28 (-10)

0714 Dived on border of assigned area northwest of TRUK,
     and apparently avoided detection by a distant twin engine
     bomber. Continued high periscope submerged patrol
     throughout the day.
1522 Sighted distant plane on easterly course in direction
     of island.
1718 Sighted two float planes.
1859 Shortly after surfacing dived for a six mile SD contact
     which closed slowly to two miles. Remained submerged
     for an hour.

April 29 (-10)

0550 Conducted submerged high periscope patrol, working
     around to lifeguard position east of TRUK for strike
     from MARSHALLS.
1928 Sighted float plane fairly close.
     About a half hour after surfacing commenced tracking
     Liberators which passed seven miles north
     of us enroute TRUK, which was thirty miles distant.
1950 Observed several explosions in direction of island.
2000 Commenced diving at approximately one hour intervals
     to avoid a determined search of the area along our
     bearing from TRUK. As our bearing was 110° from
     DUBLON, quite to the south of the track of Liberators
     returning to ENIWETOK or other MARSHALLS base, it
     was at once considered that this search was for us.
     Their search consisted of dropping increasing numbers
     of flares as they approached us from the island,
     employing three to four planes. The closest flares
     were about five miles distant. The plane contacts
     would continue to close to from three to four miles
     when they would fade out, most probably as the
     searchers came low to locate us by silhouette.
     dead in the water we were probably invisible from
     overhead. Naturally we dived at this point of their
     search.

After three such dives we had moved out to forty miles
from the island and were no longer troubled, although
sunset may have caused them to give up. It ceratinly
appeared that the planes were vectoring out along our
bearing and that they did not know our distance from
the island. Further, our distances check with data
concerning the DF'ing of the SD radar received sub-
sequently.

April 30 (-10)

0400 On surface in assigned position for carrier strikeson
TRUK, 40 miles bearing 180° T from MOEN Island.
Sighted strong radar interference on the SJ on mean
bearing 240° T, obviously from our ap roaching task
force.
0436 Sighted low flying plane or planes on SJ radar, which
passed 4600 yards from us headed toward our task force.
Sighted first planes on SD.
0530 Watched plane go down in flames over DUBLON Island.
0610 Dived for thirteen minutes and avoided a group of
0630 possibly unfriendly planes which closed rapidly to two
miles.
0643 On surfacing, flights of up to fifty planes were
continuously shuttling between TRUK and the southwest.
With the possible exception of a sinking maru, this
is the most encouraging sight we've witnessed in this
war to date.
0815 Sighted tops, then superstructures of our task force.
1025 Received first report of downed plane and were
reported position two miles off FOLEU Island at emerg-
ency speed. Bombers working over FOLEU and OLLA Islands
were most reassuring, and with numerous fighters to guide
us, located the life raft promptly about four miles
west of its reported position.
1156 With Lieutenant (junior grade) S. Scammell, USN, J.D.
LANDRON, AM2c, and H.B. GILLILL, AM2c on board,
withdrew six miles to the south.
1559 Proceeded at emergency speed on a course to round KUOP
Islands to reach life raft outside the reef on the east
side of TRUK. Fifteen minutes later however, the life
raft was reported to the north of us in the approximate
position of our first recovery. As the light could be
giving, using a twenty minute search with periscopes and
t.is position two miles east of OLLAN and one mile off
the reef. The hovering bomber and two fighters seemed
perturbed that we wouldn't follow them over to the
actual position, some five miles inside the reef. A
twenty minute search with periscopes and binoculars did
not locate the raft, headed south again to
carry out the original plan. All planes had now been
recalled, leaving us a bit naked, so to avoid a pro-
longed submerged retirement, opened fire with 4" H.E.

on the gun emplacements on the south west end of OLLAN
Island. Our ballistic of the previous week again
proved correct, for with sight bar range 3000 yards less
than radar range, the first shell burst nicely low in
the trees intended to conceal the emplacements. Fired
twenty rounds of H.E. and common which we retired, but
agreeably amazed at the ability of the 4" to stay on
the target. Corrected radar range for continuously
the gun, with occasional salvos spotted short,
appears a simple and adequate means of fire control.
At 3500 yards trained in and turned out a bit prematurely,
however, for the nips crawled out of their holes and let
fly at us. Their first splash was about 1000 yards short,
the second we didn't spot. Remained surfaced for forty
1850 minutes, then surfaced and proceeded to the east side of
TRUK at emergency speed.
2143 From position six miles east of PULAP Island on the
eastern reef, commenced zigzag search to the southwest
at ten knots. Fired green Very stars over fifteen minutes
on the turns and midway of each leg, hoping for any
sort of answer from one of the rafts. The only reply,
sighted on some occasions, was a series of red or white
lights in the neighborhood of ULAL Island, which changed
bearing rapidly as if flashed along a runway. One of
the pilots we recovered the following day had sighted our
stars, but was afraid to answer them.

May 1 (-10)

0330 Proceeded east to a position for second day's strike,
ten miles closer to the Island than on the previous day.
0340 Sighted radar interference of our task force.
0600 Sighted conning tower of Jap submarine proceeding south
around KUOP from OTTA pass. Submerged and commenced
approach. Tracked him on straight course 180° at 12
knots. When the generated range was 3000 yards and angle
on the bow 30 starboard, suddenly lost sound contact.
Took a quick look to observe our bombers and fighters
overhead and to confirm our fears that the enemy had
dived. Dropped to 150 feet and rigged for silent run-
ning, but was unable to regain contact. Headed south-
west for an hour at standard speed, then surfaced and
proceeded to the Northwest toward the reported raft of
the evening before. Spread large colors on deck to help
identify us, then reported enemy sub to the task force
commander for possible attack.
0828 Headed at emergency speed for life raft reported two
and a half miles southwest of our favorite OLLAN Island.
Before we reached the scene, a float plane from the
U.S.S. NORTH CAROLINA capsized in the cross chop in the
attempt to rescue. The other NORTH CAROLINA plane made
a precarious landing and on our arrival was towing both
raft and fellow pilot clear of the island. This action

0917 was most helpful, for we expected comp tion from
OLLAN and nearby fighters were already strafing
her gun emplacements for us.
After Lieutenant J.J. DOODLE, USNR, Lieutenant
(junior grade) R. KANZE, for whom we had somehow
been searching the night before, and R. E. HILL, AR2C, were
the second plane from the NORTH CAROLINA float
gone into the air again, we proceeded to sink the
capsized plane with 20mm fire. At this time a smoking
torpedo bomber was spotted hitting the water about
seven miles to the east. Proceeded down the bearing at
emergency speed, and opened fire on nearby OLLAN as we
passed. They had removed the trees intended to camou-
flage their position, evidently feeling it was no longer
a secret. It gave us an unobstructed point of aim, now-
ever, and our hitting 4" H.E. with a few common sand-
wiches and our supported by strafing fighters
with two bombers, must have discouraged them for they
did not return any fire.

1004 Sighted life raft and survivors ahead under circling
fighters.

1020 With Commander A.R. MAITER, USN, J.J. [UNCLEAR: L...] R2c,
and H.A. TOMPSEY, AO2c, on board, proceeded at
emergency speed to round RUOP to reach three life
rafts reported off the eastern reef. As our track took
us close by our submarine contact of the morning,
requested and promptly got good air over a blown
group, with safety, negative and the boat rolled
even our Fairbanks-Morse smoking a bit. I felt
through this spot at twenty-one knots fairly confident
that the Jap would get no more than a fleeting glimpse.

1328 As Lieut(jg) BURNS had landed his NORTH CAROLINA float
plane off the eastern reef, requested the attempt
to tow the rafts clear. He was a big jump ahead of us
however, having taken all seven men from three rafts
on board and taxied with them to seaward. They were
now in no immediate danger, so followed our escorting
planes to a raft just off LESCON Island in the bight
between RUOP and TRUK. As we thoroughly expected to be
picked up, rigged a free running line and ran it
to the SD mast for towing the raft clear while submerged,
but our strafing escorts evidently discouraged any
opposition.

1325 Recovered Lieutenant H.L. HILL, USNR, then headed for
a fighter pilot reported in the water just off the
eastern reef of UOP. By the time of our arrival planes
dropped a rubber boat to him, but he was too weak

1352 to do more than climb aboard one.

1410 After pulling perhaps our most grateful passenger aboard,
Lieutenant (junior grade) J.G. COLL, USNR, backed up
and clear of the reef and headed for the waiting float
plane at emergency speed. She was well clear, about
three miles east of SALAT Island, and no

1515 difficulty was experienced in bringing the following
on board: Lieutenant R.S. NELSON, USNR; Lieutenant
(junior grade) R. BARBER, USNR; Lieutenant (junior

J. LIVINGSTON, RM1c; R.W. GRULBE, AM2c; J. HARANEK,
AM2c; C.F. TABRU, AM2c; and R.L. BILLEY,
AM2c. The action of Lieut(jg) BURNS, in taking the rescue
party in as precarious a position as any of the downed personnel,
will be made the subject of a special report.
Sank the float plane, which had a roughly battered
tail, with 20mm fire, and proceeded at emergency speed
to round KUOP to the last reported raft south of OLLA
Island. As all planes were recalled as of 1630, and
we could not reach the raft until sunset, requested
two night fighters to assist in locating it. Our
passage through the area of our morning contact was not
quite as comfortable without air cover, but again
twentyone knots took us through in a hurry. The night
fighters joined us at sunset as we were approaching the
last reported position three and a half miles south
of OLLA, and immediately commenced their search.
Fifteen minutes later one of the fighters circled then
fired several red Very stars four miles northwest of
1830 us. Closed at emergency speed, spotting the raft from
atop the shears, as it was now too dark for periscopes.
With Lieutenant D. KIRKPATRICK, USNR, and R.L. BILLEY,
AM2c, on board, dismissed the planes and commenced
slow speed search west of the atoll.

(L) RADIO

Radio reception was good and no difficulty was
experienced in any transmissions. Of special note was
the very satisfactory two way voice communication during
the strike on K in part due to the Wardroom Hallicrafter
receiver. The frequency of 4475 could be answered by all
planes and had the advantage of being clear of the VHF
tactical frequency. It was therefore possible for planes to
direct us quickly, and for us to get their support when
needed. Voice on the R.L receiver was quite often unin-
telligible.

(M) RADAR

The performance of the SJ radar was very satisfactory
when it was in operation. Fortunately its off periods in
general coincided with bright nights when shipping could
be sighted and on the return trip. The trouble was generally
in the new type transmitter and among other things entailed
the failure of the original modulator unit, the spare, and
finally a third one obtained from the USS TRIGGER. Around
the clock repairs by our "long course" radar officer, a
first class radio technician, and a first class radioman
could only temporarily overcome the rate of breakdown. A
thousand man hours were devoted exclusively to its overhaul
with only temporary results and the knowledge that "they
hadn't said uncle" as a reward. The details of the failures

(U) REMARKS

IDENTIFICATION:

The twenty two aviators who witnessed a demonstra-
tion of submarine identification flares Mk 10, 11, and 12,
submarine emergency identification signals Mk 2 and 2 (ex-
plosive type), and Mk 1 comets (Buck Rogers gun), unanimously
doubt their ability to note any but the Mk 1 comets, and that
one too if already diving for an attack. Along the same line
is the fact that every pyrotechnic we could fire did not de-
ter a friendly submarine from making an end run on us dur-
ing our last patrol forcing us to avoid at high speed as
soon as he dived. Sure identification is becoming increas-
ingly important as we traverse a thousand extra miles of U.S.
patrolled waters. Further, it may not always be possible or
desireable to establish sanctuaries in coming operations,
such an incident arising in this very patrol when an enemy
submarine shared our area for a day or more.

Means for reliable identification is at hand in
the simple Mk 3 (mortar type) signal projector which was
issued to submarines during 1938, but orders turned in be-
fore many were installed. The order to turn them in was based
on the fact that the submerged signal gun could fire pyro-
technics of similar color. The person issuing the order evi-
dently did not consider the prohibitive delay in the use of
the submerged signal gun for a surface projector. The Mk 3
projector mentioned above provides a healthy pyrotechnic
burst and its effectiveness can be seen in a matter of a second or two, and its
effectiveness was demonstrated in one of our submarines who
after her first patrol prior to returning to the coast after her
first patrol. It successfully warded off numerous army planes,
certainly the crucial test. It is our present intention to
procure one, at least for demonstration during the training
period.

The fact that one of the pilots later recovered
observed our green Very stars during our night search east
of TRUK but was afraid to answer, indicates the need for a
simple identification under these circumstances. Rather than
reverting to any complicated arrangement using a two or three
color cartridge, specially as there is no advantage in hav-
ing the submarine signal visible at a greater range than
that from the raft, the following procedure is suggested as
well facilitated and publicized among aviators, it could
facilitate some rescues:
(a) Submarine fire single green stars during
night search as conditions permit.
(b) Raft reply with one of the five or six
red stars with which each is now provided.
(c) Submarine on sighting red star immediately
reply with two green stars and close the bearing, firing
additional stars as necessary.

NIGHT PERISCOPE:
In agreement with the U.S.S. SEAHORSE, it is hoped
that the present night periscope is not being held up by dif-
ficulties of the radar feature. The periscope itself will
eliminate that between the dark and the moonlight period
when proper attack is near impossible. This is nine tenths
of what is desired. Though the radar feature is very desir-
able, the ability to see the target group at considerable range
will permit an aggressive submerged approach with firing ranges
that will insure sure hits.

SUBMARINE R.A.D.R:
It was most disappointing to learn that the proposed
aircraft search radar had been abandoned in favor of improve-
ments to the present SD. The size of the "bed spring" and the
60 degree overhead void were evidently the main objections.
The objection by commanding officers to the moder-
ate size antenna is inconsistent, for there is hardly a sub-
marine whose shears do not bulge with underwater loops, CUO
antennas, lookout platforms, binocular rests, and clear the
bridge. Further, the proposed antenna could doubtless
be designed to fold automatically in the manner of a music
stand.
The sixty degree blank cone overhead, which at
first appears frightening, could well be given a little more
thought. Personal conversation with Commander Bernstein last
summer indicated that this radar would be infallible in de-
tecting planes up to twelve miles. In other words, unless
the enemy were coming from Mars, he would have to be flying
at approximately 50,000 feet to escape detection. Except in
very equipped planes, airmen admit that they'll probably
not spot a submarine when flying above 15,000 feet, and will
surely not detect him under the best conditions when above
25,000 feet. Thus the proposed radar seems to offer a sub-
stantial safety factor.
Overlooking the above, the weakness of the present
SD is not in its very few internal failures, but in its un-
predictable voids, its inability to detect low flying planes,
and the obvious ease with which the enemy is DF'ing and peer-
ing and homing on it.
Granting that any radar equipment must be accepted
with its limitations, the enemy is not standing still, and
the limitations of the SD may before long preclude its general
use. A static program of only improving present equipment is
therefore unsound and should be avoided. A farsighted program
would include addition of the proposed aircraft search radar,
with improvements to the present SD. If below deck space is
a problem in this installation, there's a ship's office any
boat would donate. If it is topside space, a permanent feeder
running inside or outside the conning tower, thence between
periscope shears to fixed SD radiators at shear top level.

would leave the after space available for a "bed spring" air-
craft search radar.

Except for internal failures, which will undoubted-
ly be ironed out by installation of more substantial parts,
the SJ at present is a near ideal search and attack radar.
We are, however, accepting a reduced range simply because of
the relatively low height of the reflector compared to the
much similar SC installations in surface craft. In addition
to the greater area that could be covered with a higher re-
flector, is the probable necessity of tracking the enemy at
greater ranges as his radar improves. The design problems of
a raisable reflector are not insurmountable. One could and
should be designed to operate at both the present sheer top
level and in a raised position at the height of our raised
periscope. The most logical way to accomplish this is to
first install the new aircraft detection radar in the
place now occupied by the SJ and move the SJ to the top of
the present SD mast. By removing the SD housing pipe, in the
conning tower, and installing a well, the present hoist could
raise this SD mast to the desired level. A clutch type coupling,
similar to our original periscope bearing transmitter coup-
ling, would provide a ready means for power rotation of the
SD mast in its raised or lowered positions. The wave guide could
be telescopic, its transmitter output fed to it near the
bottom of the well. If the present reflector is too heavy,
a metal sprayed plastic one could be substituted.

The minimum we should now be striving for is then
a two position SJ, an airplane search radar to augment the
SD, and the coming periscope radar.
Though the above opinions and ideas may seem too
futuristic, it must be remembered again that the enemy is
not sitting still. We are still enjoying, though on the wan-
ing side, an immense tactical advantage over him because of
our good radar. However the minute we say "this is good"
we're losing the offensive and he is catching up.
It will be just a matter of time until submarines are
again the "submerged vessels of opportunity" we used to be-
lieve them to be.

Patrol Report.

Subject:        U.S.S. TANG Second War Patrol - comments on.

          1.    Although disappointing in that no shipping loss was incurred by
the enemy, the second war patrol of the TANG under Lieutenant Commander R. H.
O'Kane as commanding officer was equally as outstanding as his first. By virtue
of remarkable cooperation with aircraft of the U.S. striking force attacking
TRUK, willingness to proceed from point to point within gun range of shore
batteries in order to rescue expeditiously personnel of downed aircraft, and
seizing the initiative by bombarding known gun emplacements when passing OLLAN
Island, twenty-two U.S. naval aviation personnel were rescued from lifeboats
and downed aircraft. During the sixty day patrol, twenty-nine days were spent
on assigned stations in Palau, Davao and Truk areas. No doubt the scarcity
of targets is attributable in part to the presence of a heavy U.S. task force
in the western Pacific.

          2.    Of five surface craft contacts, three were small patrol craft
and evaded, one was an RO class submarine which dived at a range of 3000 yards
on appearance of U.S. aircraft, and one smoke contact of two ships. It was
impossible to close this contact because of combination of air screen attacks
proximity to a shoal water on Grey Feather Bank and operation in order to take a
lifeguard station. Of fifty aircraft contacts, twenty-two were sighted by
periscope, eight were observed first by radar while four were made jointly by
radar and sight, fifteen were seen by bridge personnel during daylight and one
was discovered at night due to carrying running lights.

          3.    The performance of the SJ radar can not be classed as
completely satisfactory due to the excessive time under repair and the ab-
normal quantity of spaces required for maintenance. The comments of the commanding
officer on the general subject of radar are well taken; the use of both SD

U.S.S. TANG - SECOND WAR PATROL.

From: The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet.
To : The Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet.
Via : The Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Pacific Fleet.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Report of Second War Patrol.
 (16 March to 15 May 1944).

1. The TANG's second war patrol was conducted in areas
northwest of Palau, east of Davao, and in the vicinity of Truk.

2. This entire patrol was outstanding in patrol efficiency,
excellent initiative, and aggressive spirit. Throughout the patrol
the TANG used all of its equipment to the utmost efficiency.

3. The remarkable recovery of 22 Naval aviators in seven
different pick-ups close to the reef at Truk and within enemy gun
range is a sterling example of how cooperation between the submarine
performing lifeguard duty and planes of the striking air forces can,
by cooperation, make successful recoveries of our downed aviators.
The aggressive, successful, and well planned bombardment of Ollan
Island contributed much to the eventual rescue of the downed aviators.
This patrol report should be carefully studied by all Commanding
Officers as a guide for future lifeguard duty.

4. It is of note that the TANG's contact with the TRIGGER
and subsequent exchange of necessary spare parts was instrumental in
the latter vessel continuing on a patrol that inflicted severe damage
to the enemy.

5. The remarks made by the Commanding Officer regarding
the present and future uses of radar by submarines are greatly
appreciated. The Pro-Sub sections in this area and in the Department
are constantly working on all new developments including radar.

6. This patrol is designated as successful for Combat
Insignia Award.

7. The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, congratu-
lates the Commanding Officer, officers, and crew for the aggressive
and efficient manner in which the lifeguard duty was performed result-
ing in the recovery of 22 Naval aviators.

(A) PROLOGUE.

Returned from second war patrol May fifteenth and completed
normal refit on the thirtieth. Conducted post repair trials,
training with three days underway, loaded, and departed June 8.

(B) NARRATIVE.

JUNE 8-12

1330 Underway in company with U.S.S. SEALION for MIDWAY,
     conducting training dives, fire control drills, and testing
     communications for future coordinated patrol.

JUNE 12 (+12)

0800 Arrived MIDWAY, fueled, and located motor ground in a
     brush pigtail. Held dock trial to insure that trouble had
     been remedied.
1600 Departed for EAST CHINA SEA at two engine speed.

JUNE 12(+12) - 21(-9)

Enroute area, delaying an hour near SOFU GAN to tune SJ radar.
As experience in training showed that we could not have
lookouts and the OOD from the bridge without delaying the
dive, used this number in the daytime and kept the SD secured.
No lights, no planes and none apparently sighted us.

JUNE 22 (-9)

1706 Dived thirty miles from YAKU SHIMA prior to passing through
     COLNETT STRAIT after dark.
2000 Shortly after surfacing picked up 142 megacycle radar,
     apparently from YAKU SHIMA, with our APR-1 equipment, so gave
     it a wide berth, using our SJ periodically and never within
     forty-five degrees of the island. Though this is an arbitrary
     safety angle, an island that has radar will most certainly
     have detectors too, and the least one can expect is re-routed
     shipping.

JUNE 23 (-9)

0350 Made rendezvous with SEALION south of KUSAKAKI SHIMA, a little
     late as we had delayed to investigate a possible SJ contact.
     Patrolled submerged southwest of the island during the day,
     but with periodic high periscope searches.
2000 Proceeded to DANJO GUNTO to meet USS TINOSA.

JUNE 24-25 (-9)

0115 Made scheduled rendezvous with TINOSA and SEALION fifteen miles
south of D.N. NTO CINTO. Executive officer went aboard TINOSA,
delivering infra-red signalling apparatus, code for coordinated
attacks and TANG'S ideas for patrolling this area. With
everything in agreement, proceeded northeast for submerged
patrol south of FUKAE SHIMA, prior to closing KOSHIKI STRAITS.
0803 Sighted small patrol boat and avoided submerged.
2145 After dodging numerous lighted sampans along the 100 fathom
curve, sighted a large convoy on the SJ at 20,000 yards, just
having emerged from KOSHIKI STRAITS.
2153 As soon as the speeds were at first ambiguous, sent contact
report of convoy's position only. SEALION acknowledged.
2220 Having tracked convoy on courses between 315 and 270 at
speeds from 10 to 16 knots, answered TINOSA'S request for
convoy course and speed.
2227 Sent latest course of 280 and speed 12.

We were in what at first appeared a fortunate position on
the convoy's port bow, with a three day old moon about to set,
but as numerous bow and flanking escorts appeared on the radar
screen it became evident that undetected penetration from ahead
or from the flank would be nearly impossible.
The composition of the convoy, which had been confused
by numerous escorts and side lobes, now was clarified with
visual sighting. There were at least six large ships, in
column or three or two, surrounded by two circular screens
of at least six escorts each, and as we later discovered,
each section was further escorted ahead and astern.

ATTACKS NO'S 1 and 2

As the quarter escorts were well dispersed, elected to
approach from the stern. We passed between them without
difficulty, diverged to starboard and avoided a third patrol,
and gained position 2500 yards on the starboard beam of the
last section.
The first ship was a large modern four mast or goalpost
freighter with high composite superstructure topped by a large
short stack, believed to be (EU) of the AOBASAN M.RU class,
page 84, or KOKAI MARU, CNI 208-J (rev'd). The second ship was
a modern tanker with large short funnel, similar (EU) to the GENYO
MARU, page 277 or 279, CNI 208-J (rev'd). Both ships
were heavily loaded and most probably diesel driven as they
did not smoke.

2349 The convoy, now close to NONO SAKI, had settled on course north
     at 10 knots when we stopped, turned left for straight
2352 shots, and fired three torpedoes at the freighter, 120
     starboard track, range 2600, spread his length by constant
2353 TBT bearings, followed immediately by a similar spread at the
     tanker, 100 starboard track, range 2450. All gyros were
     between 12 right and 2 left. Observed two beautiful hits in
     the stern and amidships of the freighter, timed as our first
     in third torpedoes. The second was observed to run erratically
     to the left. The explosions appeared to blow the ship's sides
     out, and he commenced sinking rapidly. On schedule, our fourth
     and fifth torpedoes hit under the stack and just forward of
     the after superstructure of the tanker. His whole after end
     blazed up until extinguished as he went down by the stern.

0000 tly had now evaded the closest escort at 1400 yards apparen-
     convoy and five thousand yards from where our targets would
     have been. Their pips, separating from the convoy, had
     gradually disappeared from the PPI screen however, and only a
     low hanging cloud of smoke marked the spot where they sank.
0015 Sent message to other boats that we were diving and gave
     convoy's set-up, and repeated it twenty minutes later at
     SEALION's request.
0020 As the only radar interference indicated that our other boats
     would not get in, especially as the convoy was close to
     NAGASAKI whose steel mills loomed up like Hari-Kari mountain
     in for another attack. Our approach was spurred by an escort
     who closed in to fifteen hundred yards as we passed the vicinity
     of the first attack, but unable to see us in the haze of a
     slight overload, commenced dropping terrific depth charges.
     He succeeded in calling out the dogs however, and our target,
     which was first tracked at ten knots, showed a stopped, then
     a rate of better than forty knots closing. We had just
     complete a 90 degree turn when he passed sixteen
     hundred yards astern, a modern looking DE. He
     closed for a minute, but our team of overload experts,
     watching their temperatures, got us rolling at 22½ knots in
     spite of our unconverted #4 MBT. Easing off at a slight
     angle, we opened the range to 3400 yards when he show-
     ed a sound searchlight. Hoping to take advantage of the
     others, we dived a little faster than a rock, encouraged by
     the bridge diving alarm for our PCO's experience of
     illuminated the bridge diving alarm for our PCO's

ATTACK NUMBER 3

0424 Shortly after crack of dawn sighted ship on the SJ at 8000
yards which had just rounded NONA SAKI from the KOSHIKI straits.
We were already on his beam, but fog and rain prevented a full
power run-around with only occasional glimpses of our enemy.
He was a medium sized, split superstructure, IJM freighter.
PRIZE (EU) to the EHIME MARU, page 228, ONI 208-J (rev'd),
tracked at eight knots on courses hugging the coast. With
the freighter obscured by rain, dived a thousand yards off his
track, range 7000 yards. As we were 3000 yards west of
BONO MISAKI, a good firing range was insured. Turned right for
0551 a stern shot as the freighter came out of the rain and fired
four MK 13 torpedoes, range 1950, 100 starboard track, gyros
set 1.00 degrees, and the helm and the torpedoes
were set on six feet as the sea was calm and the
loading of the freighter could not be ascertained beforehand.
We had a zero angle on the boat, two of the torpedoes
broached several times and then settled down on surface runs,
throwing continuous plumes in the air. Needless to say the
freighter avoided the spread by turning toward. All exploders
operated as the torpedoes hit the beach if that is any con-
solation. After some gunfire, the freighter took refuge in
a cove north of BONO MISAKI, and as we were getting set toward
0640 the beach, surfaced and made a full power dash to the west,
unsighted by a late arriving patrol boat.

JUNE 28 (-9)

     Conducted submerged high periscope patrol on direct route
     between SHIMONOSEKI and SHANGHAI.
1945 Continued to the northwest at one engine speed.
2000 Detected 150 megacycle radar on either SAISHU TO or M.RI.TO,
     so rounded them at fifteen miles to avoid possibility of
     training the enemy on our radar policy of not closing the
     SJ within 45 degrees of known radar installations except for
     a fast periodic sweep.

JUNE 29 (-3)

0220 When 40 miles northwest of SAISHU TO, detected 95
     megacycle radar, perhaps from the eastern end of M.RI.TO
     and at the same time commenced tracking a radar contact near
     M.RI.TO at 26000 yards. This proved to be side lobes of the
     radar. The strength of our 95 megacycle radar did not in-
     dicate we approached M.RI.TO, so this island is eliminated
     as a possible source.
0441 Commenced submerged patrol near HEN SHO, half way between
     M.RI.TO and SANTAI TO off the southwest coast of KOREA.
     This position was close to the suspected route across the
     YELLOW SEA to the CHINA COAST. Low fast moving fog patches
     and fog patches made periscopes and searching difficult, so came to
     periscope depth periodically.

ATTACKS NO's. 4A and 4B.

1140 Sighted a freighter to the north on a westerly course. Com-
     menced an approach, but it soon became apparent that we could not
     reach an attack position submerged. We therefore opened the
     range on a diverging course, surfaced, and commenced an "end-
     around" bucking a heavy sea. Reduced visibility permitted
     passing the ship with only occasional glimpses at 15000 yards.
1600 Having tracked the enemy on course 255 at 7 knots, dived
     directly in his track for periscope attack. The freighter
     came on nicely, identified (EC) as the TAZAN MARU, page 215

ONI 208-J (rov'd). His masts had been cut off level with
the top of his stack, but all other details were [UNCLEAR: unshown].
He was lightly loaded, but in view of our experience of the
twenty-seventh, decided that ten feet was the absolute
minimum depth setting for this sea.
After two "dipsy doodles" to adjust position, and with
several echo ranges and
1759 bearings checking, fired two MK 14 torpedoes, one at his
foremast at one at his mainmast, 90 port track, range 1250
yards, speed seven. Raised the periscope again to see the
splash of each torpedo at its point of aim, but they appar-
ently passed under.
The enemy turned toward and gave us two close depth
charges shortly after we had reached two hundred feet, fifty
feet off the bottom. Fifteen minutes later, as we were
approaching periscope depth, a loud crackling noise came over
sound followed by a third fairly close charge.
1910 We went back down, but searched and surfaced fifteen minutes
later with nothing in sight. This points to the possibility
that this last was a delayed action depth charge used in this
shallow water for the purpose of keeping a submarine down
while the ship escapes.
2030 It didn't work in this case, however, for we made radar contact
in a little over an hour and commenced tracking again. Our
enemy had gone to the north, was tracked on course 040, then
070 at ten knots, heading for KO TO, and the ten fathom curve
off the KOREAN coast. We closed sufficiently to identify
him, and then turned the tracking over to the section on
watch with the plan to attack after moonset in the lee of
D. IKOKUSAN GUNTO.

JUNE 30 (-8)

The freighter was a little out in his navigation, however,
as firing in the lee was now impossible and the islands
still, determined to attack from a range to insure hits even
with broaching torpedoes.
0040 Commenced approach from his starboard bow directly down
wind and sea, stopped with range 1500, angle on the bow
0101 "feeler" torpedo set on six feet from number five tube, range
750 yards, 92 starboard track, 6 degree left gyro, enemy speed
nine knots. In spite of the heavy seas it ran perfectly,
its phosphorescent track visible among the white caps right
to the freighters side. The explosion amidships, just
thirty seconds after firing, was as beautiful as it was
reassuring.

It broke the freighter's back, his stern sinking with a down
angle, his forward section with an up, in a cloud of fire,
smoke, and steam.
His gun crew had guts, however, and got off five or six
shots in spite of their tilting platform. (When they had
ceased firing we relieved about twenty lookouts in rapid
succession, and today our crew is discussing single versus
multiple torpedo fire. We'll continue, however, to fire as
many as is considered necessary to sink the enemy.)
The inability of the enemy to sight us is considered due
in part to our light grey camouflage, ideal for this area,
and the known inefficiency of lookouts into wind and sea.

0130 Proceeded to the west for submerged patrol after daylight.

JULY 1 (-8)

0946 Commenced submerged patrol one hour after dawn, forty miles
west of KO TO. Maneuvered to close a sailing junk, and
surfaced to look him over. He lowered his sail, fired four
rounds of four inch, but our plan to get some information
from his became unnecessary when our high lookouts sighted
smoke over the horizon.

ATTACK NUMBER 5

1015 Commenced tracking smoke which quickly developed into two
columns, and then the masts of two ships. One ship was
zigging at intervals of from three to twelve minutes, while
the other's movements indicated an escort. After gaining
position ahead and tracking these ships on base course 260
1322 at eight knots, dived for periscope approach and attack. As
the group came on, maneuvered for a MK 18 stern shot at the
escort who was about 1500 yards on the freighter's starboard
bow. This placed us directly ahead of the freighter and in-
sured a stern shot at him if the escort was not hit. The
escort was now identified as a small engine aft freighter with
gun forward (the depth charges aft probably 'the AMARU'
(EU) of the AMARU MARU, page 270, ONI 208-J (rev'), changed
in that the bridge structure was aft. As TDC bearings were
creased to ten knots, took several echo ranges and found his
1444 speed had in-
creased to ten knots. Now with the set-up changed, fired two
MK 18 torpedoes, one under his foremast, the other under his
stack, 100 port track, range 1250, depth setting six feet,
then went ahead at standard speed to gain position on the
freighter.
As the moments dragged out and time for the torpedoes
to hit had apparently passed, expressed some quiet oaths

about eight torpedoes, only to have the words jammed down
our throats by a swell explosion. Slowed and looked to see
the escort's stern in the air in a cloud of smoke, and the
freighter turning back. At least half a dozen persons observed
this ship sink, timed in two minutes and twenty seconds.

ATTACK NUMBER 6

We now felt that we had the freighter caught between third
base and home, for he was nearly one hundred miles from the
Korean coast and his track led through the probable positions
of both SEALION and TINOSA. Sent them the contact report
on the next hourly schedule and continued trailing submerged
at five knots, with the smoke still in sight.
1916 surfaced at dusk and commenced overtaking at full power on
three engines, charging with the other and the auxiliary.
Again we're thankful for our FAIRBANKS-MORSE, for as it later
proved, our eighteen and a half knots in this combination
was every bit necessary.
After radar contact with the enemy had been gained it
became apparent that we would have to pass him up moon south
of KO TO, but with full power on four main engines, we were
waiting for him with two minutes to spare as he rounded the
southern tip of the island.
2224 Dived a mile and a half off the island, 1200 yards north of
the track of the enemy who was now six thousand yards away.
He slowed for a good periscope look, as we commenced our
southern turn for him with three echo ranges and periscope
bearings, the set-up was checking again as we commenced our
turn for a 090 port track, and a straight bow shot. With range 500, 90
2247 gyros now zero, fired two Mk 14 torpedoes by constant
well deck,
the first at the middle of his after cargo which must have been munitions of some sort
and the second at the middle of his forward one. The
first torpedo hit as timed in twenty seconds exploding
with a short
section of the bow was all that remained intact of the whole
ship, and it sank in twenty seconds. The second torpedo
was "robbed".
This was a medium freighter, identified during and after
attack number 5 and at close range by moonlight prior to
firing as similar (EU) to the SAMARANG MARU, page 130, ONI
208-J (rev'd).
2251 Surfaced close to debris and proceeded sixty miles to west
for our usual patrol.

2250 Made scheduled rendezvous with SEALION, and executive officer
     boarded her to exchange information. She was unable to reach
     our first convoy, and failed to receive our message concerning
     the freighter, but had sunk an AK on the way to this expected
     traffic route. It will be interesting to compare the reports
     of SEALION and TINOSA with ours, for the expected route runs
     between their areas as assigned by TINOSA while ours lies to
     the north. They have in general patrolled on the surface
     using their SD and have been driven down by planes. Though
     this may not be conclusive, it appears that they have shunted
     the traffic by us, for we've been patrolling submerged,
     surfacing for a good look now and then, and keeping SD secured.
     We've seen ships and no planes since after our attack on the
     27th.
     The SEALION has decided to patrol the SHANGHAI area,
     while we proceed north.

JULY 4 (-8) (WHAT A FOURTH !)

0005 Set course for position on the direct route between DAIKO-
     KUSAN GUNTO and OSHI TO at three engine speed. As the sky
     was overcast at dawn, continued on the surface, and shortly
0408 Sighted heavy masts of a ship to the northeast.

ATTACK NUMBER 7

     Stopped, put him astern, and determined his approximate
     southerly course, and commenced a full power dash to get on
     his track. We were a bit hampered by fifteen trawlers or
     fishermen, but with the enemy's bridge and stack aft already
     over the horizon, it was their presence which prevented our
     detection.
0500 With an on the bow now 5 starboard, dived and continued
     approach. The massiveness of the ship as it closed resembled
     a man-of-war, and twenty minutes later a wide zig-zag
     our first good identification look. Her hull and arrangement
     were similar (BB) to the KUPOSIO MARU, page 272, ONI 208-J

During the next hour we were abaft his beam as he closed
the ten fathom curve, zigging leisurely. On our straight
course at full speed we closed the range continuously
however, and though on most observations with angles on the
bow up to 150 the situation looked hopeless, he finally
reached a nine fathom finger west of A TO and came back
to a southerly course. Our fathometer, which had been
showing four fathoms under our keel, now in quick succession,
showed three, two, and then merged with the outgoing signal,
0626 so we backed down and fired three K 14 torpedoes at stack,
amidships, and forward by constant bearings, range 2600,
90 starboard track, speed 8, depth setting eight feet.
Turned left with full speed and rudder, and heard healthy
hits time as our first and second torpedoes. We slowed
and looked to see only the bow, stern, and masts sticking
out of the water under a huge cloud of smoke.
0631 Surfaced, surrounded by 34 assorted fishing boats obviously
awe-stricken. There were about fifty survivors in the water
and large life boats, but as we could not dive in the eight
to nine fathoms if we approached closer, headed west at
three engine speed. The stern had sunk before we surfaced,
and as we cleared the area, observed the protruding bow tip
go under in bubbling foaming water.

This ship was observed at moderate ranges from various
angles for over an hour, and the following features indicate
that she was converted for use as an (AV) seaplane tender or
aircraft transport: Her masts and booms were approximately
twice as heavy as those of a large freighter. Her bridge
structure was open aft forming a hangar. Her stern had been
extended by a large platform with triangular stern piece and
was fitted with kingposts and long boom. An auxiliary radio
mast topped her after superstructure, fitted with several
antennas. The survivors were far in excess of a normal
tanker crew. Except for her black stack and masts, she was
war color.
Comparing this ship with similar conversions in available
publications, her standard displacement is estimated at
sixteen thousand.
0730 Then we cleared of any small craft which could report our
course, headed north and dived an hour and a half later,
forty miles from the position of our attack.
1500 Commence hearing very distant explosions, probably 52 miles
distant to be exact.

1340 Having passed OSEI TO, sighted smoke beyond the OYONU group
     of islands, tracked on a southerly course. While figuring
     where and how we could get him under a full moon in more than
     ten fathoms, our problem was solved by a faint wisp of smoke
     to the west.

ATTACK NUMBER 8

     Switched approach to this, and closed at standard speed
     submerged until clear of OSEI TO, then surfaced in
1953 late twilight, but under a full moon. Twenty minutes later
     he was sighted on the radar at 18500 yards. We were in a
     fortunate position ahead and had only to move on to his base
     course of 110 which lead toward OSEI TO and the bulge of the
     ten fathom curve. His long low silhouette was visible at
     15000 yards, so tracked from that range, determining his
     moderate zigs of 20 to 30 degrees at 5 to 10 minute intervals.
2041 Dived and commenced moving in by radar to 9000 yards, then com-
     menced moonlight periscope attack.
     As he came on his silhouette developed into a long engines
     aft ship with raked bow, and with tripod mast and king posts
     forward and aft. Distinctive also was his mushroom topped
     bridge structure. After closing a left zig at standard speed,
2128 checked set up with several echo ranges, and fired last two
     bow torpedoes, one at forward end of after superstructure,
     the other forward of his bridge, range 900 yards, 90
     starboard track, gyros near zero, depth setting eight feet.
     The first torpedo hit just aft of the bridge, breaking the
     ship's back. The tripod foremast could be seen in the smoke
     and debris tilting aft as he sank by the middle. Let the crew
2131 hear the breaking up noises by the sound-LHC method, then surf-
     aced to pick up a survivor. It was necessary to snake one of
     the two large overturned lifeboats alongside with grapnels,
     and threaten with tommy gun bursts to convince the one visible
     survivor to come on board. Recovering a life ring was much
     simpler.
     Both the new life boats, life ring, and visual observation
     of the vessel before firing show this to have been a new
     ship. She does not appear in any identification book. Our
     PCO and executive officer both observed this ship together
     with the commanding officer prior to firing, and estimate
     her tonnage to be 10000, the same as the modern tanker her
     hull was designed after.

With some assistance as to detail from the prisoner, the
silhouette of this ship has been drawn and is submitted.
Of interest is the prisoners knowledge of the exact position
where they were torpedoed, and apparent familiarity with
shipping routes.
Not so clear are his figures on tonnage, which range from
7000 to 10200, but he finally got across the idea that this
latter figure was iron ore in her holds. Phonetically her
name was AMA-AUKA MARU of the YAMASHITA KISEN KAISHU.

sailing junk, headed northwest at three engine speed to round
KAKUREPPU ISLAND and approach the DAISEI group before dawn.

0345 Dived for submerged patrol.
0845 Commenced hearing distant explosions, indicating that the op-
position is still way behind us.
0917 Sighted distant smoke drawing to the south close to the
shore, south of the DAISEI ISLANDS. Although this
was inaccessible in six fathoms of water, it practically
assured an early attack against this coastal traffic off
CHOSEN MAN.
1942 Proceeded on the surface to CHOSEN MAN (CHOPPEKI POINT).

ATTACK NUMBER 9

2257 When 8 miles west of CHOPPEKI POINT, after having tracked
the ship with two reverberation and several second pulse echoes,
sighted a ship on the SJ at 29000 yards. Stopped and tracked
it out to 32000 on a northwesterly course at 9 knots, then
developed a grueling end around. Under a full moon on a
rippleless sea, the ship was visible at 20000 yards, so to
insure an unalerted enemy for our last two torpedoes, passed
on outside of 15000. When 30 miles from GAICHI RETTO
(BLONDE GROUP), stopped on his track seven miles ahead for
a final speed and course check, then dived on a parallel
course for a submerged attack. Checked the set-up by a radar
observation at five thousand yards when the freighter was
temporarily lost in the surface haze, and immediately ex-
perienced hopelessly fogging periscopes. The set-up checked
perfectly, however, showing us 500 yards off the track, so
returned to 60 feet to wet the scopes. He was clear and
big on the next observation, at 1100 yards by echo range,

0320 so turned for the stern shot. Fired two Mk 18 torpedoes,
  one at his mainmast, one at his foremast, range 900 yards,
  90 starboard track, gyros near 180, depth setting 6 feet.
  Both torpedoes hit exactly as aimed and there was only
  floating wreckage and broken life boats in sight when we
  surfaced two minutes later. The freighter was medium
  sized, mast funnel mast, composite superstructure, similar

2155 When between DANJO GUNTO and the southern mine field,
  sighted five equal sized pips on the SJ at 16000 yards on
  our track ahead. We were at four engine speed, which in
  part accounts for a range of 12000 yards before we got them
  astern. The night was lightly overcast with a near full moon
  breaking through, but nothing was sighted on a fairly sharp
  horizon at this range. As we conducted a reverse end-around
  to get on their quarter, tracked the group on course 310,
  nearly the reverse of our original course, then 340, then
  060. Closed to their quarter cautiously until blinker signaling
  was sighted at 13000 yards, but no blurbs against the horizon.
  Five legitimate Jap ships would contain at least one smoker
  and would have been visible at a much greater range. Con-
  vinced that this was a "killer group", undoubtedly directed
  by our late plane, gave them a wide berth and continued

2145 153 megacycle radar signal steadied at maximum strength,
     apparently trained on us. As we were already between GAJA SHIMA

     NAKANO STRAIT into a rising moon. The 153 megacycle radar
     remained steady with maximum signal as we passed NAKANO SHIMA,
     indicating its location there. Five small vessels, two of
     them smoking, heading from north and south into the strait,

L (CONTINUED)

     Tests of the lower frequencies assigned submarines were
conducted with the U.S.S.SEALION while enroute Midway.
     The results were startling in that the lowest two
frequencies would not carry beyond six thousand yards in daytime
and eleven thousand yards at night even with maximum power. It
was also found that with minimum power the range of 2204 KCS
could be reduced to about twenty miles. The data recorded though
incomplete will be submitted to the Force Communication Officer.
It is felt that further tests should be conducted to determine
the limiting range of various frequencies for a specific power
setting of the TBL transmitter, as these could be of considerable
value in coordinated attack group operations. Further it appears
that a frequency lying between 450 and 2204 is desirable. It
might even be advantageous if this fell in a Japanese broadcast
band.

     The SJ Radar gave comparatively little trouble during this

FIRST ENDORSEMENT to
U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Report
of War Patrol No. 3
dated 14 July 1944.

From:
To :
Via :
Subject:

1.
The TANG on this, her third war patrol, sixteen days
after entering her assigned area, the East China and Yellow Seas, had
fired 24 torpedoes in ten attacks and sunk 8 ships for a total of
39,000 estimated tons with 12 hits. The entire patrol covered a per-
iod of 36 days.

2.
(a) Attack No. 1 and 2. On the night of 24 June, TANG
on the surface, made an end around and tore into a convoy of six large
10 escorts and with six torpedoes (three at each) sank a 7500 ton
freighter and a 10,000 ton tanker. Mark 23 torpedoes were fired at an
average range of 2500 yards, on 120 and 110 degree starboard tracks
with 10 foot depth setting. One torpedo was observed to run errati-
cally.

(b) Attack No. 3. Soon after dawn on 26 June an SJ
contact at 6,000 yards provided a target in the form of a medium sized
unescorted freighter. TANG made a quick end around run, submerged and
fired four Mark 18's from stern tubes with a depth setting of six feet
on a 100 degree starboard track, range 1950. Two of the torpedoes
made surface runs alerting the target in
time to allow
torpedoes to be avoided. The freighter ran for cover while TANG sur-
faced and cleared the area just ahead of a late arriving patrol boat.

(c) Attacks 4A and 4B. Just prior to noon on 29 June,
while patrolling submerged an unescorted medium freighter estimated
at 5500 tons was sighted on a course which prevented a good firing
position. TANG turned away, surfaced, made an end around and
four hours later submerged and fired two Mark 23's on a 90 port track
range 1,250 yards with depth set at 10 feet. Both missed (probably
passed under ship). Three close depth charges followed, one of which
detonated under circumstances which might point to use of a time delay
feature for shallow water. TANG surfaced and chased for an hour be-
fore regaining contact on SJ. Made an end around and at a 750 yard

a 92 degree track with 2000 yards and it sank
under the eyes of TANG's crew. The apparent efficiency
camouflage job is noted with interest.

(d) Attack No. 5. On the morning of 1 July TANG on
surface sighted and tracked a 4,000 ton medium freighter and a 2,000
ton escort freighter. Submerging for periscope attack, she fired two
Mark 14's at the escort-freighter range 1,250, 100 port track with
depth set at six feet. One hit and the ship was observed to sink in
2 minutes and 20 seconds. The freighter reversed course and TANG
trailed submerged until dusk when she surfaced, made an around, sub-
merged again and in

(e) Attack No. 6. Sank the freighter with one hit out
of two Mark 23's fired at a 500 yard range on a 90 port track with
depth set at six feet. The manner in which this ship blew up indicates
a cargo of munitions.

(f) Attack No. 7. At dawn on 4 July TANG made an end
around on the nests of a ship and dove one hour later to continue the
approach on what developed into a 16,000 ton (MAY) Seaplane tender or
large transport. With rapidly shoaling water and the keel about to
scrape the bottom TANG backed down and fired three Mark 23's, range
2000, 90 starboard track with depth set at 8 feet. Two hits sank this
ship and TANG surfaced to clear the area in the midst of 34 fishing
boats with about fifty survivors thrashing around in the water and in
large life boats.

(g) Attack No. 8. In the late afternoon of the same
day, 4 July, smoke was sighted and closed until picked up by radar
at 18,500 yards and sighted at 15,000. After tracking to determine
his zig plan resulted in the firing of TANG's last two Mark 23's at a 900 yard range, 90 starboard
track with depth set at 8 feet. One hit sank this ship and TANG sur-
faced and took aboard the one visible survivor and a life ring. The
prisoner was obtained from observation and questioning of the
sunken ship converted from a modern tanker hull of about
10,000 tons.

(h) Attack No. 9. On the night of 5 July under a full
moon an SJ radar contact at 29,000 yards was tracked out to 32,000
yards and an end around run made which placed the TANG seven miles

Care of Fleet Post Office,
San Francisco, California,
17 July 1944.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Report of Third War Patrol.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

2. In a submerged radar periscope attack the last
two torpedoes, Mark 18's from the stern tubes were fired at 900 yards
range with a 90 degree track, depth setting 6 feet. Both torpedoes
hit at top minutes later on surfacing only floating wreckage and
broken life boats remained from a medium freighter of 4,000 tons.

3. This, the third consecutive outstanding patrol turned
in by the TANG, was characterized by the same aggressive and
efficient fighting spirit that was so noticeable in her first and
second patrols. To her enviable record of sinking 5 ships totaling
41,969 tons on her first patrol and the efficient rescuing of 22 naval
aviators on her second patrol the TANG now adds 8 more ships sunk for
an additional 59,000 tons on this patrol.

4. Twelve hits out of 24 torpedoes fired, three of which
were seen to run erratic, is an excellent score in any league and
one which the TANG's Control Party may well be proud of.

5. Material condition on return from patrol was excellent.
Refit will be accomplished by Division 62 Relief Crew assisted by the
Submarine Base Midway.

6. The Commanding Officer, Officers and crew are most
heartily congratulated on this very outstanding patrol. It is re-
commended that TANG be credited with inflicting the following damage
upon the enemy:

U.S.S. TANG - THIRD WAR PATROL.

From: The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet.
To : The Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet.
Via : The Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Pacific Fleet.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Report of Third War Patrol.
(8 June to 14 July 1944).

1. The third war patrol of the TANG was conducted in the
East China Sea and Yellow Sea Areas.

2. This patrol was an outstanding example of excellent
judgment, expert area analysis, bull-dog tenacity, and severe damage
to the enemy. In a period of 12 days the TANG made nine torpedo
attacks, sinking eight vessels. Each attack was carefully planned and
brilliantly executed. This patrol sets a record for submarines opera-
ting in the Central Pacific Area as to the amount of damage inflicted
upon the enemy.

3. The TANG was one of three submarines assigned to work
in the area West and North of the Japanese Empire. This was not a
coordinated attack group but a group designated to work adjacent
areas, close together, and planned in order to pass contacts from one
to the other.

4. It is of note that many radar contacts wore made using
the APR-1 detector.

5. This patrol is designated as "Successful" for Combat
Insignia award.

6. The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, congratu-
lates the Commanding Officer, officers, and crew for this very out-
standing war patrol. The TANG is further congratulated for the out-
standing performance of its three war patrols during which the TANG
has sunk 13 enemy vessels for 97,969 tons on two of them and rescued
22 aviators on the other. The TANG is credited with having inflicted
the following damage upon the enemy:

S U N K
1 - Large Freighter (AOBASAN MARU
class) (EU) - 7,500 tons (Attack No.1)
1 - Large Tanker (GENYO MARU class) (EU) - 10,000 tons (Attack No.2)

U.S.S. TANG
(A) PROLOGUE.

Returned from third war patrol July fourteenth. The refit
by SubDiv 62 and Submarine Base, Midway, completed on the twenty-
fourth, is considered our finest to date. Conducted normal
training and departed July thirty-first.

(B) NARRATIVE.

July 31 (+12) - August 7 (-9)

1555 Underway for areas four and five at two engine speed. Con-
ducted usual training dives and fire control drills, and enjoyed
yachting weather.

August 8 (-9)

0950 Dived a half hour to avoid a bomber sighted at about eight
miles.
1410 Dived an hour for another bomber about ten miles away.
2351 Sighted MIKURA SHIMA in the NANPO SHOTO, but because of
known radar installations nearby, proceeded to INAMB. SHIMA,
a small pinnacle, for checking our SJ.

August 9 (-9)

Conducted submerged patrol near INAMB. SHIMA in the vicinity
of numerous plotted contacts. Continuous searching, with
1900 periodic sweeps at forty feet finally located what might
have been smoke beyond ZENI SU, so on surfacing proceeded
to the northwest to investigate. No contact was made, but
as all the surrounding areas were vacant, closed the coast
in the bight west of OMAI SAKI for submerged patrol at dawn.

August 10 (-9)

0441 Dived six miles from the beach and continued closing the
coast. A few minutes later sighted single mast and super-
structure of an apparent patrol boat which continued its
sweep down the coast.
0903 Sighted a large engine-aft ship against the beach, escorted
by three bombers. We were already on his track six thousand
yards away, so except for closing the traffic route, our
approach served only to impress our OOD's with the necessity
of sticking one's eyeballs on the beach to pick out the
shipping.

August 10 (-9) Cont'd.
ATTACK NO. 1.

1010 Within an hour of securing from battle stations for this
     first ship, and having avoided another patrol by continuing
     in, there, an old type loaded tanker right against the beach
     headed for OMAI SAKI. As four bombers were the only escorts,
     took a sounding to find we were still in forty fathoms. A
     standard speed approach closed him to 1200 yards where with
     echo and stadimeter ranges checking, fired three Mk 23
     torpedoes spread his length by constant bearing, 100 star-
     board track, speed 8.5, set at eight feet, gyros near zero.
     Hits or explosions on the beach three thousand yards
     away resulted. Two minutes after firing the tanker, alerted,
     reversed course away, so commenced evasion, thoroughly ex-
     pecting bombs or aerial depth charges. We rolled on the
     bottom a little at eighty feet during our turn to evade,
     but reached deep water and commenced periscope patrol in
     another hour.
1500 Very distant counter attack commenced.
1920 Surfaced south of DAIO SAKI, and staying clear of its 252
     searching for any night shipping.

August 11 (-9)

0413 Having doubled back to MIKI SAKI, dived three miles west of
     the point, then closed to intercept any morning shipping.
0515 When visibility was just becoming good through the periscope,
     sighted smoke against the beach and the bow wake of an escort.
     Before we could reach an approach course, the escort and a
     large engine-aft freighter ducked around MIKI SAKI and into
     KADA AN, thence down the coast.
     Patrol activity increased steadily with one pinger
     generally in sight, an inshore patrol proceeding back and
     forth a thousand yards off MIKI SAKI, and a motor boat re-
     sembling a landing barge with six lookouts making a nuisance
     of itself.
1244 After ducking for a modern looking gunboat loaded with depth
     charges, heard extremely loud pinging coming up the coast.
     The A/S vessel was not as big as his ping, but by coming
     straight to MIKI SAKI, then changing course to seaward, he
     kept our stern to us off the fifty fathom curve as we
     forced us off the fifty fathom curve as we KADA AN and ducked
     around MIKI SAKI with the TANG hopelessly out of position for attack.
1355 With changing tide, fogging periscopes nearly ruined the rest
     of our day for we were spotted by the motor boat when
     longer exposures became necessary. He was extremely difficult

1635 to shake, but on sighting smoke, a half hour run at standard
     speed into OWASE WAN left him out on the 80 fathom curve.
     This put us in about forty fathoms of water, on the route
     followed by the tanker, and on their most probable track.

ATTACKS NO. 2 and 3

The smoke, which had been in two columns, developed into
two anti-funnel-mast split superstructure freighters in column.
They were escorted well to seaward by the gunboat previously
sighted, and by a smaller escort on the other bow. During the
remainder of the approach, the leading ship was identified (EC)
as of the BIYO MARU class, page 220, ONI. 208-J (rev'd), and the
second, about two thirds her size, as similar (LU) to the
AKASHI MARU, page 230. Both ships were heavily loaded.
1740 When in position 1700 yards on the convoy's beam, just prior
     to giving a final set-up, sound reported fast screws on our
     port quarter. A quick look showed our gunboat coming in fast
     about a thousand yards away, evidently warned by the motor
     boat of our presence.
1741 Fired three Mk 23 torpedoes at the leading freighter, range
     1300, 110 starboard track, depth setting 6 feet, spread 150%
     of the target's length by constant bearings, followed by a
     similar spread at the second freighter on an 80 starboard
     track. Took a quick low power sweep to observe the gunboat
     evidently having
     the field boiling past our stern,
     misjudged our course and giving the wrong lead. Reassured,
     swung quickly to the leading target in time to see the first
     torpedo hit right in the middle, evidently in his Scotch
     boiler for he disintegrated with the explosion.
1743 On our way deep, timed our fourth and fifth torpedoes to hit
     the second freighter, followed by a tooth-shaking depth
     charge attack. As the gunboat's screws on our port bow showed
     his intent to turn us toward shallow water, we made a full speed
     dash, assured by single ping soundings taken with each barrage.
     Even at this speed, the twisting, scrunching, breaking-
     up noises were loud in the direction of the targets. After
     twenty-two close ones, the depth charges drew aft and we were
1821 able to return to periscope depth in thirty-eight minutes.
     The gunboat was now about 4000 yards on our quarter, the
     other escort at the scene of the attacks apparently picking
     up survivors, and one plane was circling the area. Nothing
     else was in sight.

ATTACKS NO. 2 and 3 Cont'd.

August 12 (-9)

2005 Continued to seaward at five knots and surfaced at dark with
     depth charging still progressing, and the area astern of us
     being swept by searchlights.
2010 Headed for IZU SHIMA at 18 knots.

. 0420 Commenced submerged patrol between INAMBA SHIMA and MIHURA.
     SHIMA back on our schedule.
0736 Maneuvered to avoid a patrol boat and proceeded south of
     MIURA SAKI as the Kuroshio was setting us on the island.
1505 Again the enemy had succeeded in chasing us from a likely
     spot, for after twenty-four depth charges and continuous
     planes and patrols, sighted distant smoke in the direction
     of our dawn position.
1918 As our attempts to maintain, and then to regain contact with
     the smoke had been futile, and even a six knot enemy ship
     would reach TOKYO BAY ahead of us, proceeded to the IZU
     SAKI-INUBO SAKI area to intercept coastal traffic.
2300 Moved into MATSUURA WAN three miles from the beach to insure
     radar contact on any shipping.

August 13 (-9)

0312 As no contact was made and the visibility dropped to zero from
     wood smoke rolling from the beach, withdrew for submerged
     patrol at dawn.
0654 Sighted distant smoke to the southeast headed for NOJIMA SAKI
     and TOKYO. Four bombers and a patrol boat prevented a surface
     approach. Our twelve mile approach fell
     short by six thousand yards of attaining a firing position.
1921 After surfacing, took one more turn up the 100 fathom curve
     to INUBO SAKI before proceeding south to the TORI SHIMA area
     of the southern islands.

August 14 (-9)

0429 When 40 miles east of HACHIJO SHIMA, dived to avoid detection
     by a patrol yacht. His maneuvering during the day prevented
     our usual surfacing for high periscope searches, so kept him
     in sight for a 4" target if better shipping did not show up.
     Numerous planes indicated that he may have spotted us too.
1430 Surfaced to regain contact but dived in twenty minutes on the
     approach of a plane.

GUN ATTACK NO. 1

1753 Surfaced to maintain contact and check all guns, then closed
1832 to seven thousand yards and commenced firing.
     The enemy was tenacious and wiry, twisting and turning
     and closing the range at every opportunity, and though he

     It was impossible with his movements and the 4" rate of
     fire to stay on for more than one or two hits, and only eight

1904 On surfacing closed the coast just north of KANTORI SAKI to
intercept any night shipping. The numerous sampans and row
boats previously reported are still in evidence, but
nothing interfered with our closing to 3000 yards from the
beach, where contact with any shipping would be assured.

where attack on any coastal traffic was assured.
0605 Avoided a patrol boat coming down the coast.

ATTACK NO. 4

0947 Sighted tops and smoke of a freighter coming out of the mist
from the north. As the enemy was inside the ten fathom curve,
we still had to close the coast a little and dodge numerous
sampans and row boats, but his escorts were well clear on his beam
and port bow to seaward. The freighter was a modern, medium
sized, engine-aft ship. With range 900, 123 gyros around 30,
fired two Mk 23 torpedoes at his stack by constant bearings,
depth setting six feet.
The first torpedo evidently missed astern and exploded on
the beach, while the second torpedo left the tube with a
dud, but did not run.
We had to take our first eight depth charges at periscope
depth, but had gained deep water for the next twenty-two.
2142 Surfaced and headed around SHIONO MISAKI to attack the coastal
traffic between this point and ICHTYE SAKI. 82, 99,
tonners were in evidence but nothing came of it.

slowly for an afternoon attack.
0855 A large ship and two escorts proceeding eastward and rounding
SHIONO MISAKI out of reach changed our plan, and we closed the
next freighter two hours later. She was a medium sized new
engine-aft job with escorts well ahead, but a 3000 yard
torpedo run broke off the attack, as a better shot was prac-

ATTACK NO. 5

1243 After closing the beach to a twenty fathom spot off
        OKINO SHIMA, headed west to buck a two knot easterly set.
        Sighted smoke then a medium mast-funnel-mast freighter
        coming up the coast unbelievably close to the beach. Our
        approach consisted mainly of ducking the two killer escorts and
        turning left for a stern shot.
1317 At a range of 1650 yards, fired three Mark 18-1 torpedoes
        with a 150' of the freighter's length by constant bearings,
        110 port track, depth setting six feet, gyros around 20 left.
        All torpedoes exploded on the beach.
        We were at 200 feet, two fathoms off the bottom, when the
        first depth charge let go, and reached deep water twenty
        minutes later. Our evasion at 100 turns kept everything aft
        including late arriving pingers.
        Checks on the firing bearings with our Mark S, and plot
        of the firing showed everything in order. This left only the
        possibility of deep running torpedoes to explain our persis-
        tent misses, so decided to keep slugging and continue checking
        torpedoes.
1916 On our first trip to MIKI SAKI we were caught napping by
        a freighter and escort which rounded the point just after
        dawn. Radar searches had shown no night traffic, so felt sure
        shipping might wait at OMASE or OMASE AN just north of MIKI
        SAKI. On surfacing, proceeded clear of KANTORI SAKI
        to probe the above bay.

0020 After passing MIKI SAKI, slowed, crossed the 100 fathom curve.
        Proceeded around KUKI SAKI into OMASE WAN. Side lobes
        were confusing, but we soon found "a pip where no pip ought
        to be". The night was black and only the long shape of the
        enemy could be seen until we circled him to get him away from
        the background. There he was quite visible, identified
        as the gunboat who had harassed us during our first visit,
        to take it off then with those tooth-shakers. He tracked at
        slow speed and was obviously anchored in about 20 fathoms
        two miles northwest of KUKI SAKI. Holding our breath, we
        crept in slowly to twelve hundred yards, twisted then stead-
0142 ied for a straight stern shot and fired one Mark 18-1 torpedo
        at his middle set on three feet.

The phosphorescent wake petered out after a hundred yard
run. The torpedo evidently heading down, and hit bottom
with a loud rumble, timed half way to the enemy, where there
should have been 250 feet of water. It was tracked by sound
to this moment, but after the rumble cleared away, nothing
more was heard.

0144 Fired a second Mark 18-1 torpedo set on three feet, feeling
sure the enemy had been alerted by the first. It's wake was
dimly visible directly to the target, tracked also by sound,
but it passed underneath, apparently running on the deep side
too.

0158 With one salvo of three left aft, circled for a bow shot,
tube with range 900, fired a Mark 23 torpedo from number 5
and absolutely steady and the gyro angle zero, it took a
thirty yard jog to the left before settling towards the target
and missed astern.

0200 Still whispering, though the last two torpedoes must
have roared past him, fired a second Mark 23 torpedo from
number 6 tube set on zero aimed at his gun forward. It took
a jog to the left also, but settled down right for his middle.
The explosion forty seconds later was the most spectacu-
lar we've ever seen, topped by a pillar of fire and more
explosions about five hundred feet in the air. There was
absolutely nothing left of the gunboat.
This vessel was observed at close hand previously during
daylight. She was new in appearance, flush deck, with raised
gun platforms forward and amidships mounting what appeared to be
double purpose guns. Aft of the midship platform was a goal-
post structure, possibly for use in sweeping, or as a by-
product or director platform. Her stern had very long almost
horizontal depth charge racks holding fourteen counted depth
charges a side, and what appeared to be Y-guns on the center-
line. On observation before firing she measured between
225' and 270' in length and is estimated to have a standard
displacement of 1500 tons.

Feeling that our difficulties had been mainly in sluggish
steering and depth engines, withdrew at full power to spend
the day checking afterbodies of our remaining torpedoes.
After giving the steering engines a good workout to in-
sure they were free, checked our rudder throws. On three of
the six torpedoes they were three quarters to one degree
heavy. With a careful trim and no pressure in the boat, swung
all torpedoes and calibrated depth springs.

OMAI SAKI and the scene of our first attack of the patrol.

August 23 (-9)

0100 In position on the fifty fathom curve west of OMAI SAKI, moved
slowly to the bight off FUKUDA. We were six thousand yards
from the beach and it is certain that no shipping passed,
though navigational lights were burning.
0417 Submerged this time in our desired position and commenced a
periscope patrol. Plane activity started right after
daylight followed by the first patrol a half hour later.
0803 Sighted smoke of two freighters as they rounded OMAI SAKI and
commenced closing their track. As expected, they were practic-
ally aground, so closed to 1000 yards from a wreck off FUKUDA,
undoubtedly one of our sub's handy-work. Though the escorts
were clear, an unexpected zig and a third previously unobserv-
ed small freighter put us underfoot. A full speed dash
succeeded only in letting us clear as they boiled by our bow
and stern about two hundred yards off.
0923 We had been secured from battle stations less than a half hour
when an old type destroyer, four bombers, and a float plane
commenced searching down the coast. At first it appeared that
we'd been spotted, but his circling tactics resembled the
routine sweep we'd observed off MIKI SAKI. Though we had our
torpedoes set at two feet and he came very close, we could
secure nothing but sharp tracks or large angle shots. Why his
split-splitting pinger didn't pick us up will remain a pleasant
mystery.

ATTACK NO. 7

1017 With the destroyer just clear the reason for the activity
became apparent with the sighting of masts and high super-
structure of a ship coming down the coast toward OMAI SAKI.
He was escorted by a large PC or DE ahead, an SC on his bow,
our aircraft previously sighted overhead, and an LST and a PC
astern.
We had been forced out a little by the destroyer and a
high speed approach was necessary to insure a short firing
range. It was therefore not until the angle on the bow opened
ten minutes before firing that the full import of our enemy
became apparent. The decks of his long superstructure were
lined with men in white uniforms, as was his upper bridge.

1110 Made another five minute dash to close the track, slowed and
1113 took two echo ranges, and fired three Mark 23 torpedoes spread
     his length by constant bearings, 105 starboard track, range
     800 yards, speed 8, depth setting six feet, then commenced
     swingline for a stern shot at the LST.
     The first and third torpedoes hit beautifully in his
     short well deck forward, and the after part of his long sup-
     erstructure, giving him a twenty degree down angle which he
     maintained as he went under with naval ensign flying.
     There is no ship resembling this in any of the ONI
     publications, though if the BUENOS AIRES MARU on page 45 were
     given a raked bow and her stack cut down level with her
     superstructure, she would be a close approximation. She was
     not, however, a hospital ship. The gross tonnage of this
     vessel would be in the neighborhood of 10000 tons and her
     standard displacement 15000.
1121 Our LST headed for the beach and someone dropped two depth
     charges, not close, which permitted us to surface and get two soundings
     and clear out at 100 turns. For once, depth charging the
     submarine seemed to take second priority, undoubtedly as
     survivors were picked up, for it was ten minutes before they
     started to rain. We had then reached deep water, and two
     hours at high speed, then gradual slowing, kept everything
     astern, including a multi-ship echo ranging search during
     the remainder of the day.
1907 Following our hit and run policy, commenced a full power
     dash to round SHIONO MISAKI for another crack at the coastal
     traffic before a waxing moon made evasion difficult.

     near SHIONO MISAKI, but it appears to be poor, or in part

0336 Sighted a ship on the SJ a yards about on the 100
     fathom curve. After tracking it at six knots and gaining
     position ahead, picked up and sighted another ship close to
     the beach. As this latter seemed to be the larger and the
0428 former probably an escort, switched approach and dived for a
     periscope attack in the dawn that was breaking. When the
     generated range was 3000 he commenced signalling with yardarm
     blinkers, then turned away displaying a super load of depth
     charges and efficient looking guns. Though we had our tubes
     ready for this patrol, he wandered shoreward, never giving us
     a setup. It appeared that he had been relieved by a second
     patrol which occupied our attention for the next two hours.

0950 and too late we saw him lead a modern medium sized diesel
tanker out of KAZAMPO, just east of ICHIYE SAKI, and head
for SHIONO MISAKI hugging the coast.
    Activity increased toward noon with the passage down the
coast of a HISHUN MARU class patrol with two stripes on his
stack. Within an hour sighted smoke beyond SHIONO SAKI, and
assuming our escort commander would soon be back with the
freighters moved in to the forty fathom curve. He was there
all right on the next observation with two large freighters as-
tern. They were both riding high and practically on the beach
escorted astern by a similar patrol, on their beam by two twin-
screw destroyers, and five PC's fanned out to the 100 fathom
curve. Their echo ranging frequencies varied from about 500
cycles, nicely audible on the JP and sounding like a pile
driver on the lowest limit of the JK, to above the upper limit
of the JK at 37 KCS.

1930 Convinced that this was a little too much for a twenty
fathom shot with our last three torpedoes, slithered under the
inboard PC, a fathom or two off the bottom, and reached deep
water with only one token depth charge.
    Our presence was at least suspected in this location, com-
menced a high speed run around SHIONO and KANTORI SAKI to att-
empt to establish a contact after daylight. This point lies about
five miles southwest of MIKI SAKI and is tipped by a small is-
land three hundred yards off the beach around which shipping
must pass.
    Our previous observations showed that the motorboat
patrols did not range this far from MIKI SAKI. If the echo
ranging patrols could be avoided in the fifty fathom curve,
fifty fathoms available without moving off their track,
waiting for attack would be assured.

2342 Closing NIGISHIMA was not without incident however, for with
rain squalls and radar efficiency poor in frequent rain squalls
we only sighted a submarine on our beam parallel to us, un-
believably close at 1100 yards. Put him astern and moved out
to five thousand yards where tracking showed he had changed
away also. We then commenced an end around and attack if enemy.
Positive enemy identification would have been impossible at night.
Shortly after we changed course for our end around his pip at five thousand yards
grew smaller and disappeared apparently as he dived. After
four hours we changed course and proceeded to submerged positions,
and searching for an hour, proceeded to NIGISHIMA SAKI.
    As this is the same area in which four torpedoes missed
the TAUTOG, it will be interesting to know if any friendly sub-
marine was in this position thirty miles southeast of KANTORI
SAKI. His diving as soon as we reversed course suggests radar,

0420 Dived three thousand yards from NIGISHIMA SAKI and moved to
     within fifteen hundred yards of the beach. Patrol activity
     started within a half hour, but turned back short of us for
     some time, probably as a continuous stream of cargo sampans
     was the only escorting necessary. We did not attack them,
     how.r, for on a return sweep down the coast a PC continued
0805 directly on to us. We were two fathoms off the bottom at 275
     feet, rigged for silent running, and depth charge too, when he
     passed airly overhead. He gave no indication of suspecting
     our presence, and we were able to come to periscope depth as
     soon as he passed. Two repeat performances by the PC sweeps
     off HISHUN MARU class patrol, and planes on every observation,
     indicated c ming shipping, but they also prevented sufficient
     observations to fix our position, and we were forced to run
1135 a mile down the coast when smoke appeared around MIKI SAKI.
     The tops, now visible, developed into a medium mast-funnel-
     el-mast and a small engine-aft freighter. Guessing they would
     continue across ADASHIKA WAN, swung left for a stern shot with
     our last torpedoes. They turned into the narrow bay however,
     giving us a 130 port track with a range between 1500 and 2000
     yards. Confident we could do better, and influenced a little
     by an escort about to take off our periscope, broke off the
     attack.
     We had been back abreast of our island off NIGISHIMA but
1429 an hour when more smoke came in sight. This proved to be
     a pile driver with a deep throated pinger again sounding like a pile
     driver on the JP. The JP was too realistic where the noise
     started to scrape and klonk along the bottom at 275 feet
     reassuring when he shifted to short scale on passing 250 feet
1530 above us, and especially so when he commenced driving piles
     again.

ATTACKS NOS. 8 & 9

1715 During the next hour, two and then three patrols swept
     down the coast, followed by distant high frequency echo ranging from
     the coast. Though its peak was above the range of our
     receiving, it grew steadily louder until four escort vessels
     were in sight. The coast was obscured by passing rain, but
1743 soon the enemy ship came in sight very close to the beach.
     She presented a starboard angle, so closed the beach to get
     on her track before turning off for a stern shot. On the next
     observation we were on her port bow, so came to the reverse of
1800 her course for low parallax firing.
     The enemy was now identified as a modern medium sized
     diesel tanker, heavily loaded.

She was the identical vessel that slipped by us out of KAZAMPO
the previous morning. Her quarter escort dropped astern as
she came on, three others remained fanned out on her starboard
bow, while the fifth ranged ahead. Our navigator was correct
when he tabooed turning for a straight stern shot, for our
first echo range, inadvertently taken 180 degrees out, showed
800 yards to the beach. The second, on the enemy, checked
with the periscope stadimeter at 600 yards, and was a perfect
1305 bearing. We fired the first Mark 18-1 torpedo at his stern, the
second amidships, and the last a third ship length ahead, right
for the middle of the three escorts nearly in line of bearing
on his starboard bow. Though the depth setting was six feet
and gyros around 60 degrees, the first two hit exactly as aimed
and the third just blew hell out of the leading escort.
Though observed sparsely this latter is believed to have been
of the KUSHIRO MARU class with standard displacement of about
600 tons.

1808 What was left of the tanker had now sunk and the stern
escort was making a run toward where his quarter would have
been. Expecting some close ones, put him on our port bow and
headed for deep water. The initial barrage permitted high
speed and single ping soundings, and in fifteen minutes we rea-
ched deep submergence.

The enemy obviously never knew where the torpedoes had
come from, and though his search became systematic with a total
of sixty-eight depth charges, our 100 turn evasion outflanked
him.

It is considered that the design of the trim type controller

both poor and antiquated. The unreliability of this controller
approaches a major defect in the trim pump installation, where it
will not stand up under frequent use and fails repeatedly.
This is essentially the same controller that was installed in
USS ARGONAUT and improved in the LAHCO by addition of a stainless
steel cover, which had to be left off to make the frequent repairs.
It could well be classed with the Model T Ford, and has the same
characteristic crank and choke. Its failures are not traceable to
inexperienced operators, as it fails as readily for old hands.

(N) SOUND GEAR AND SOUND CONDITIONS.

Sound conditions were fair. Of interest is the wide
frequency range of enemy pinging. It is considered quite probable
that many patrols previously considered to be listening only, are
actually echo ranging on frequencies higher than our receivers.
A higher frequency receiver to determine this
alone would be valuable.

(O) DENSITY LAYERS.

Excellent layers were encountered south of HONSHU, generally
beginning between 100 and 150 feet.

(P) HEALTH, FOOD, AND HABITABILITY.

Good.

FIRST ENDORSEMENT to
U.S.S. TANG (SS306)

of 3 September, 1944.

From: The Commander Submarine Division FORTY THREE.
To: The Commander-in-Chief, UNITED STATES FLEET.

(2) The Commander Submarine Force, PACIFIC FLEET.
(3) The Commander-in-Chief, U.S. PACIFIC FLEET.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306), Report of FOURTH War Patrol,
Comments on.

1. The FOURTH War Patrol of the U.S.S. TANG was of
thirty three days' duration, seventeen of which were spent in
the assigned areas. The report is excellently written and
should be of great value to submarines which patrol this
general area, the coastal waters of JAPAN. The courses of
action taken, the reasons therefor, and general conduct of
this patrol reveal submarine operations of the highest order.

TORPEDO ATTACK NO. 1 DAYLIGHT, SUBMERGED
10 AUGUST 1944

Three torpedoes fired at a tanker at 1100 yards' range and
with excellent firing data resulted in no hits and no explosions
on the beach 3,000 yards away. With depth of water of only eighty
feet, it is possible that initial dive of Mk. 23 torpedoes caused
them to strike bottom.

TORPEDO ATTACKS NO.2 & NO. 3 DAYLIGHT, SUBMERGED
11 AUGUST 1944

Position was attained 1,700 yards on the beam of two
freighters in column accompanied by a gunboat and a smaller es-
cort. Three torpedoes were fired at the first ship and a similar
salvo at the second ship. After a quick look showed the gunboat
proceeding rapidly and closely across the stern, one hit was
observed amidships in the first target, resulting in a
disintegrating explosion. Two timed hits were heard in the
second target as TANG took evasive action. The counter-attack

Subject: U.S.S. TANG - Report of Fourth War Patrol.

1. Forwarded, concurring in the remarks of Commander
Submarine Division FORTY-THREE, and with particular emphasis in
paragraph three (3).

2. The evasion tactics employed by the Commanding Officer
of the TANG (paragraph J), allowed penetration of shoal water for at-
tacks on coastwise and anchored shipping with excellent results. As
the wide open sea areas diminish by reason of further U.S. Naval
conquest, it is incumbent upon all submariners to develop the tactics
of attack and evasion in shoal water. The tactics used in this patrol
point the way. The Commanding Officer stated verbally that in his
opinion enemy vessels hugging the coast were cramped in their zig-zag
tactics, and therefore resorted to frequent changes of speed.

3. The intelligence data gathered and presented in this
report is a model of lucidity.

4. Again, it is the pleasure of Commander Submarine
Squadron FOUR to congratulate this outstanding ship on an outstand-
ing performance against the enemy.

U.S.S. TANG - FOURTH WAR PATROL.

From: The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet.
To : The Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet.
Via : The Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Pacific Fleet.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Report of Fourth War Patrol.
(31 July to 3 September 1944).

1. The fourth war patrol of the TANG was conducted off the
Coast of Honshu in the Japanese Empire waters.

2. The TANG, continuing her illustrious record, closed the
coastline and sought out enemy traffic with daring and skill. She en-
countered first rate enemy anti-submarine forces and underwent intense
depth charging. Due to expert evasive tactics, however, she avoided
any serious damage and made nine aggressive attacks on the elusive
coastal traffic.

3. This patrol is designated as "Successful" for Combat
Insignia award.

4. The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, congratu-
lates the commanding officer, officers, and crew for this fourth con-
secutive, aggressive, and highly successful patrol. During these four
patrols the TANG has built up the outstanding record of 18 ships sunk
for a total tonnage of 120,469 tons, and one 4,000 ton ship damaged
in addition to having rescued 22 downed aviators and damaged one small
craft by gun fire. The TANG is credited with having inflicted the
following damage upon the enemy during this patrol:

DECLASSIFIED

REPORT OF WAR PATROL NUMBER FIVE
U.S.S. TANG (SS306)

(A) PROLOGUE:

Returned from 4th Patrol on 3 September, 1944 and conducted normal
refit at the U.S. Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor, T.H. In order to
take part in the coming Formosa raid and to be in a position inside
the Formosa Straits to intercept Japanese reinforcements for the
coming Philippine Campaign, training and loading were completed four
days in advance of schedule. Loaded 24 Mark 18 Mod 1 torpedoes already
prepared for the U.S.S. TAMBOR, who had been delayed.

(B) NARRATIVE:
24 September 1944:

1300 Departed for Formosa Strait via Midway, proceeding at full power
to this last fueling base.

27 September 1944:

0700 Moored at Submarine Base, Midway and received their usual good
welcome and services. With fuel in every available corner,
departed at noon for our patrol area. Proceeding at two engine
speed.

27 September 1944 - 5 October 1944:
(East Longitude Date)

Routine training enroute to station showed gratifying results.
Received information that the TRIGGER - SUNFISH pack were looking for
a small Jap ship whose last reported position plotted directly
on our track. We were apparently ahead of these boats by
a few hours ahead of us and had proceeded via Saipan,
so felt we stood a good chance of finding him first.

6 October 1944:

Ran into threatening weather which quickly developed into a
full-fledged typhoon. Continued on the surface still in hopes
of intercepting the enemy, but soon found ourselves on the
inside circle, with seas and wind which would prohibit
any sort of attack if he were located. The barometer dropped
to 27.80, the waves broke over the raised periscope, and even
had small waves on their backs. It was a sight such as none
of us had witnessed before. Needless to say, our bridge watch
had been secured and the ship closed up, running on the battery.

================================================================================
PAGE 175
================================================================================

It was frankly considered too late to dive as we often hung at
60° by the bubble inclinometer in the control room. What the
momentary extra loss of stability on diving, especially if the
ballast tanks flooded unevenly, would have brought about is still
a question in our minds.

7 October 1944:
Having worked through to the safe side and with slowly moderating
seas, proceeded toward Formosa Straits. Our first fix showed us
to be 60 miles in a direction opposite to that which we
steered while pulling clear of the storm.

8 October - 9 October 1944:
As the sea permitted went to three-engine speed. Dived for one
plane which we are quite sure could flap its wings however.

10 October 1944:
With the mountains of Formosa in view dead ahead from noon on and
the top of Yonakuni Shima rising on our starboard hand, went to
four-engine speed so as to pass into the Strait shortly after dark.
About 2100 made contact with and tracked a small craft which
turned out to be a patrol vessel when observed from 5,000 yards.
Left him astern and continued on past Kirun around the northern
tip of Formosa inside Kahei Sho and into our area.

11 October 1944:

ATTACK NO. 1

0400 Then about four miles west of Puki Kaku made radar contact at 17,000
yards on a ship moving up the coast from Pekusa Point. Tracked
him at 14 knots making us at first suspicious of his character, but
as the range closed he was observed to be a large modern diesel
freighter heavily loaded presenting a low silhouette. Moved on
to his track and dived for one of those never failed crack-of-dawn
attacks. Maneuvered for an 800 yard shot as he came by and fired
three Mark 18 Mod. 1 bow torpedoes, spread to cover his length. The
first two hit exactly as aimed sinking this heavily loaded ship immed-
iately. Surfaced as soon as the smoke had cleared away to find no
survivors and only wreckage and several empty lighters half
swamped, drifting 'bout in the water. Proceeded at full power
down the coast for a submerged patrol during the day well clear
of the opposition which would arrive shortly. Dived off Pekusa Point
where a north or south bound ship could be spotted coming in
either direction, permitting a submerged attack if necessary, but

- 2 -

================================================================================

preferably tracking until dark as these shallow waters offered
no satisfactory evasion tactics. The west coast of Formosa is
literally covered with airfields, and planes were in sight on
practically every periscope observation.

1000 A strong northerly wind sprang up against the prevailing
current which quickly whipped the surface into a sufficiently
severe chop to make depth control difficult. This same chop,
however, was soon to stand us in good stead for at noon
masts of another north bound freighter were sighted down the coast.
He was running inside the 10 fathom curve zigging frequently.
Though we could reach his track by moving in at high speed and
have some battery left for evasion, our original plan of track-
ing till dark seemed more prudent under the circumstances.
There then developed our longest submerged tracking problem in
which we moved with our target 27 miles up the coast. This
seemed surprising but with the enemy zigging frequently in
a heavy wind and sea, his speed made good was little
more than ours running on a straight course at 80 feet between
ziggers. Our tracks converged and he passed directly
over us at sundown.

ATTACK NO. 2

At dark we surfaced 4,000 yards astern of him, passed him up
at the same range, avoided a couple of stationary patrols,
moved on to his track, then turned off for a stern set up.
The night was black and spumoy permitting us to lie with
our stern to him at 500 yards as he bucked the heavy seas.

2100 With a salvo of three ready to fire with a liberal spread, fired
a single Mark 18 Mod. 1 torpedo at his middle with practically zero
gyro on a 75 port track. Our experience of the morning was not
a mistake. We were clicking and this one hit with a terrific
explosion. Only the first few members of the fire control
party to reach the bridge saw any of the ship before it went
down. We now experienced something new in anti-submarine
tactics in the nature of estimated 40 mm. fire from the beach.
It was directed straight up, however, and we were quite content
to let them believe that our China based planes were aloft.

Proceeded down the coast avoiding the two stationary patrols
and encountering a third which was easily shaken off.

================================================================================
PAGE 177
================================================================================

12 - 14 October 1944:
Sighted a properly lighted hospital ship on a northerly course
which we looked over from close aboard. He appeared to be in
every respect complying with International Law.

0600
Commenced submerged patrol off the Formosa Coast. Only patrol
boats and planes were sighted throughout the day. On surfacing
proceeded to the northwest to a focal point of the probable
shipping routes from both Takao and Kirun to Foochow. Foochow
seemed the logical destination for any Japanese shipping in
the Formosa ports which, forewarned, would be attempting to
escape from our carrier strike. It turned out to be a good
point, but only for patrol craft. Much rainy, squally weather
permitted getting closer of them on the surface than after sub-
merged approach, observation and evasion.

Conducted numerous searches along enemy retirement tracks
until the Formosa strike was completed. On these watches and
up close to Kirun the fires set by our boys were observed
to be blazing furiously day and night.

15 - 17 October 1944:
Moved over to the China coast and conducted a brief
periscope patrol just south of Haitan Island. Shipping
of a thousand tons or less can follow the dangerous channels
behind this island group. Our position was chosen to
intercept any worthwhile shipping attempting to clear the
Formosa area. However, absolutely nothing was sighted, so
after two days in these treacherous waters we moved into
the center of the Strait.

18 - 19 October 1944:
Patrolled in Formosa Strait, encountering nothing but patrol
craft. We were greeted on surfacing by radar-equipped planes
who seemed to be assisted in their search by the presence of
also possessed radar. As it appeared to be more a case of
being hunted than hunting, we moved northeast to the original
lucky spot off Formosa Point, then on around the northern tip
of the island to patrol off the port of Kirun. Friendly radar
showed on our SJ to the east, probably one of the TRIGGER -
SILVERSIDES group. Other radar continued to be so strong on our
detector on all the usual frequencies that we stopped worrying
about it except to fill in the necessary log to help out in its
future tabulation. Patrolling off Kirun was almost prohibitive
due to the constantly changing weather and persistent large swells.

================================================================================
PAGE 178
================================================================================

18 - 19 October 1944 (Con't)
     The strong currents made it inadvisable to make very far into the
     harbor and the actual presence of shipping could not be de-
     termined.

19 October 1944
2200      Headed for the China Coast, having received word of an enemy task
     force heading north along the China Coast. Commenced a full power
     run which would intercept them before dawn.

20 October 1944
0400      Made radar contact at 30,000 yards on an enemy group heading
     south instead of north as expected. There followed an approach
     which quickly developed into a trailing operation on our target,
     a Katori cruiser and two destroyers, making 19 knots. Their
     erratic zigs at least every three minutes per itto kept us
     on their quarter where with a bit of luck or with stean attack
     attack would have been possible. Five times in a row we guessed
     wrong as to the direction of his next zig, and finally it was
     impossible as our slow Mark 18's just plain wouldn't reach him
     before he would have been off on another leg.

     As it was necessary to slow to twelve knots before re-
     leasing those torpedoes, and the cruiser would be opening the
     range during this slowing down period, it was necessary to re-
     open position not more than 6000 yards astern of the cruiser for an
     up-the-tail shot. Dawn was approaching and so was the Formosa
     Bank just north of the Pescadores, when we crawled into 800
     yards. This is as far as we got, however, for he illuminated us.
     We got down before the bullets landed and expected a severe
     rubbing from depth charges. We were disappointed in the outcome,
     and swore never to be without stern torpedoes forward again.

     The enemy evidently suspected other submarines and did not
     release the escorts to work us over. A good air and surface craft
     search started about noon, but we were well to the north of their
     probing. On surfacing the hunt was still on and with a sick radar
     went north clear of the Strait for repairs and a little rest from
     almost continuous operations.

21 October 1944
0000      Continued submerged patrol north of the Formosa Strait then
     proceeded back to the China Coast off Turnabout Island.

2000 and nearly fired on a PC-DE type patrol proceeding down the
coast in dark stormy weather. We didn't like the looks of the
situation as seas were rolling nearly over our bridge and his erratic
zis-zags made a surface attack precarious. Then the range was 2500 yards
with angle on the bow about 20°, as if by mutual consent the enemy
reversed course and high tailed it. We did likewise and probably as
happy as he at the outcome. Our aversion course headed us back toward
the Formosa coast so continued on for a submerged patrol on the
following day.

22 October 1944
1000. Continued on toward the coast commencing a submerged patrol at about
1000. The usual numerous aircraft were sighted during the day.
Their quantity and types indicating an influx of planes probably as
replacements for those destroyed during the Formosa raids and very
possibly also for support in the Philippines.
1800 Shortly after surfacing the SJ radar became temperamental and quit.
Our industrious radar technician and officer commenced the usual
non-stop repairs. Headed north for a safer operating area until they
were completed, as this was no place to operate without an SJ.

0630 On the first trial of the revamped SJ the operator reported land
at 12,000 yards where no land ought to be. Commenced tracking,
immediately discovering a small pip moving out in our direction.
Put him astern and bent on the turns. He evidently lost his original
contact on us for he changed course and commenced a wide sweep
in our direction. The convoy was composed of three transports
quickly developed as we were able to assume the original position
of this destroyer just ahead of the convoy while making a 2-mile
inspection tour. The convoy was composed of three large modern
tankers in column, a transport on the starboard beam, a freighter in
the port hand, flanked by DE's on both beams and quarters. After
zigging with the convoy in position 3,000 yards ahead we dropped back
between the tankers and the freighter. On the next zig, stood and
turned right for a nearly straight bow shots at the tankers as they came
on, firing two torpedoes under the stack and engine room of the nearest
tanker, a single torpedo into

the protruding stern of the middle tanker and two torpedoes
under the stack and engine space of the far tanker. Tor-
pedoes range was 300 yards and the maximum 300 yards. Tor-
pedoes were exploding before the firing was completed and all
three tankers were burning, sinking, or already sinking.
It was a terrific sight to see three blazing
tankers, but there was only time for just a glance, as the
destroyer was in position crossing our stern. Completed
set-up and was about to fire on this vessel when Leibold, my
Boatswain's Mate, whom I've used for an extra set of eyes on
all patrols, properly diagnosed the maneuvers of the starboard
transport who was coming in like a destroyer attempting to ram.
He was boxed in by the sinking tankers, the transport had no place
to dive, so we had to cross his bow. It was really
thriller with the TANG barely getting on the inside of
his turning circle and saving the stern with full left rudder
in the last seconds. The transport commenced firing its large and
small caliber stuff so cleared the bridge before realizing
it was all above our heads. A quick glance aft, however, showed
the tables were in turned for the transport was forced
swing in an attempt to avoid colliding with the freighter
which had also been coming in to ram. The freighter
transport's starboard quarter shortly after we commenced firing
four torpedoes spread along their double length. At a
range of 400 yards the crash coupled with the four tor-
pedoes was terrific, sinking the freighter nose down almost
instantly while the transport hung with a 30° up angle.

The destroyer was now coming in on our starboard quarter at
1300 yards with DE's on our port bow and beam. We headed for the
bow so as to get the destroyer astern and presently
watched the DE turn away, he apparently having seen enough
destroyer still hadn't lighted off another boiler and it was
possible to open the range slowly, avoiding the last
then the radar range to the DD was 4,500 yards he gave up the
chase and returned to the scene of the transport. The DD's
bow still showed on the radar and its pip was visible.
were 6,000 yards off, however, another violent explosion
took place and the bow disappeared both from sight and the
screen. This explosion set off a gun duel amongst the
vessels who fired at random apparently sometimes
and sometimes just out into the night. Their confusion
was truly complete. It looked like a good place to be and
so we cleared the area at full power until dawn.

Our attack log showed that only 10 minutes had elapsed from
the time of firing our first torpedo until the final explosion
that the transport's bow went down.

2000 Surfaced. Nothing but patrol boats were sighted during the day,
     but at night a search similar to the one previously encountered
     indicated the possibility of this being a trap. In any case
     there was little doubt about the heat being on this area. Headed
     north where deeper water would at least give us a better sense of
     security.

24 October 1944

0600 Commenced submerged periscope patrol. On surfacing at dark headed
     for Turnabout Island feeling that the Japs would now scarcely run
     traffic other than in the shallow protected waters along the
     China Coast. On approaching the islands at a range of 35,000
     yards other than land pips appeared on the radar screen until at
     tractive ranges the SJ was absolutely saturated.

     The Staff had been correct in their estimate of the sit-
     uation that the Japanese would likely send every available ship
     in support of the Philippine Campaign. The Leyte Campaign was in
     progress and the ships of this convoy as in the one of the 23rd were
     all heavily loaded. The tankers all carried planes on deck,
     and the sterns of the transports were piled high with
     apparent plane crates.

ATTACK NO. 4

     The convoy was tracked on courses following the ragged coast
     at 12 knots. The Japanese became suspicious during our initial
     approach, the two escorts commencing to run on opposite course to
     the long column, firing bursts of 40mm and 5" salvoes. As
     we continued to close the leading ships, the escort commander
     obligingly illuminated the column with 30" or 40" searchlights
     to signal with. It gave us a perfect view of our
     first selected target, a three deck, two stack transport;
     the second target, a three deck one stacker; and of the third,
     a large modern tanker. With ranges from 1400 yards on the first
     transport to 900 yards on the tanker, fired two Mk. 18 torpedoes
     with three deliberate salvoes to pass under the foremast and
     mainmast of the first two vessels and under the middle and after
     of the tanker. In spite of the apparent early warning and the
     sporadic short bursts of automatic weapons to scare the
     submarine, no evasive tactics were employed by any of the ships.
     The torpedoes commenced hitting as we paralleled the convoy to
     search out our next two targets.

Our love for 18 Mod 1 torpedoes after the disappointing end
experience of 22 October was still restored as all torpedoes hit nicely.
the next six hours. We passed a medium freighter, about at 600 yards and
turned for a stern shot at another tanker and transport astern of
her. Fired a single stern torpedo under the tanker's stack and one
at the foremast and one at the mainmast of the transport. The ranges
were between 600 and 700 yards. Things were anything but calm and
peaceful now, for the escorts had stopped their turning tactics and
were directing good salvoes at us and the blotches of smoke were
behind us going to full power to pull clear of the melee. Just
after firing at the transport, a full fledged destroyer emerged
under her stern and headed for us. Just exactly what took place
in the following seconds will never be determined, but the tanker
was hit nicely and blew up, apparently a gasoline loaded job. At
least one torpedo was observed to hit the transport and an instant
later the destroyer blew up, either intercepting our third torpedo
or possibly the 40mm fire from the two DE's bearing down on our
beam. In any case, the result was the same and only the transport
remained afloat and she apparently stopped.

To make us yet untouched, all gunfire either having cleared over
our heads or being directed at the several blurps of smoke emitted
when bleeding for more speed. When 10,000 yards from the transport
we were all in the clear so stopped to look over the situation and
re-check all our last two torpedoes which had been loaded forward during
our stern tube attack.

A half hour was spent with each torpedo, withdrawing it from the
tube, ventilating the battery and checking the rudders and gyros. With
everything in readiness started cautiously back in to get our crippled
target. Two DE's were patrolling on his seaward side, so made a wide swoop
in very slow so as not to be detected even by sound. She was
lower in the water but not definitely sinking. Checking our speed
at 6 knots, fired our 23rd torpedo from 900 yards, aimed
just forward of her mainmast. Observed the phosphorescence in the
wake head. Fired our crippled target, fired our 24th and last torpedo
at 6 knots, made up our speed. Ranged up on emergency speed as this
was our speed and turned sharply to the left. Completed part of a fish
tail maneuver in a futile attempt to clear the turning circle of this erratic cir-
cular run due to the phosphorescence of its wake. It struck abreast
the tops with a violent explosion about 20 seconds after firing.
The tops were blown off the only regular ballast tanks aft and the
after three compartments flooded instantly. The TANG sank as
you would drop a pendulum suspended in a horizontal
position. There was insufficient time even to carry out the last
order to close the hatch. One

consolation for those of us washed off into the water was the
explosion of our 23rd torpedo and observation of our last target
settling by the stern. Those who escaped in the morning, were
greeted by the transport's bow sticking straight out of the water
a thousand yards or so away.

Convoy contacted by radar consisting of three
large tankers in column with a medium transport
and a large freighter to starboard (west) and a large
freighter to port (east). Escorted by a destroyer steaming
on the beam and DEs on each quarter. Leading DD gained
contact, but lost initial contact. TANG took position
ahead of formation and then dropped back between tankers
and freighters. Following a zig turned right for nearly
straight bow shots on tankers. After firing 2 torpedoes
at leading tanker, 1 at overlapping middle tanker and 2
at trailing tanker, TANG barely escaped being ram-
med by transport. The transport continued to
swing and was struck on starboard quarter by the
freighter who also was attempting to ram. Four
torpedoes were fired at these two ships
simultaneously. TANG evaded escorts on the sur-
face after being subjected to heavy but inaccur-

Description
Contact was by radar in early evening on convoy
of large ships proceeding South, hugging the
Coast, at 12 knots. Convoy consisted of at
least 14 large vessels in column escorted by
at least 1 fleet type DD and twelve DEs. Some
of the DEs initially were to seaward of the
convoy while the DD and other DEs were on the
landward side.

During the initial approach presence of TANG
was apparently suspected as seaward DEs com-
menced firing at random. Approach was contin-
ued on leading vessels as a large searchlight
was trained down the column illuminating a 3
deck 2 stack transport, a 3 deck single stack
transport and a large modern tanker.

Two torpedoes each were fired to hit these
three vessels as convoy took no avoiding action.
TANG then took parallel opposite course to re-
maining ships, passed up a medium freighter at
600 yards to fire one torpedo at a large tanker
and two at a large transport while Escorts
fired at TANG and her engine smoke.

A Fleet type destroyer came around the stern
of the transport as firing was completed, but
either hit a TANG torpedo or ran into cross
fire of the escorts as she blew up.

TANG pulled clear to check the last two tor-
pedoes while the situation cleared.

Returning to the last transport TANG fired last two
torpedoes to finish her off.

Report of the Loss of the U.S.S. TANG (SS306)

Introduction

This report is compiled from my observation and the stories of
the eight other survivors as related to me at the first opportunity
after capture.

The U.S.S. TANG took on board the twenty-four Mark 18 Mod 1
electric torpedoes prepared for the U.S.S. TIREDA who was being
delayed. All torpedo personnel in the TANG had attended electric
torpedo school and it is assured these torpedoes were properly
routined while on station. In fact, the performance of the first
twenty-three torpedoes in all running perfectly, with twenty-two
hits, attests to this.

The last two torpedoes were loaded in tubes three and four
during the final stern tube attack. After pulling clear of the
enemy escorts, opportunity was available to spend an hour checking
these torpedoes before closing the enemy to finish him off. They
were partially withdrawn from the tubes, batteries ventilated, gyro
pots inspected and steering mechanism observed to be operating
freely.

With the submarine speed checking at six knots and the ship
conned for zero gyro, the twenty-third torpedo was fired. Then its
phosphorescent wake was observed heading for its point of aim on
the ship. It stopped and it was believed to be a hot run tube number
four. This torpedo curved sharply to the left, broaching during

- 18 -


================================================================================
PAGE 192
================================================================================

the first part of its turn and then porpoising during the remainder.
Emergency speed was called for and answered immediately. On firing,
and a fishtail maneuver partially completed in an attempt to get
clear of the torpedoboat's turning circle. This resulted only in the
torpedo striking the stern abreast the after torpedo room instead
of amidships.

The explosion was very violent, whipping the boat, breaking
H.P. air lines, lifting deck plates, etc. Numerous personnel as
far forward as the control room received broken limbs and other
injuries. The immediate result to the ship was to flood the after
three compartments to gether with number six and seven ballast tanks.
No one escaped from those compartments and even tho the forward engine
room was half flooded before the after door could be secured.

The ship, with no normal positive buoyancy aft and with three
after flooded compartments, went down instantly by the stern. With
personnel in the conning tower and on the bridge falling aft due to
the angle, there was insufficient time to carry out the order to
close the hatch.

Personnel in the control room succeeded in closing the conning
tower lower hatch, but it had been jimmied in the explosion and
leaked badly. They then leveled the boat off by flooding number
two main ballast tank (opening the vent manually) and proceeded
to the forward torpedo room carrying the injured in blankets.

When the survivors from the forward engine room and battery
tery compartment reached the mess room, they found water already
above the eyeport in the door to the control room. On testing
the bulkhead flappers in the ventilation piping they found the
water not yet at this height. They therefore, opened a port
letting the water race through, then proceeded on to the torpedo
room. This made a total of about thirty men to reach an escape
position.

During this time all secret and confidential publications were
destroyed first by burning in the control room, and then in the
forward battery compartment as the control room flooded. This
latter seems unfortunate since a great deal of the smoke entered
the forward torpedo room.

Escaping was delayed by the presence of Japanese patrols which
ran close by and by occasional depth charges. This is unfortun-
ate for an electrical fire in the forward battery was becoming
severe. At about six o'clock, four parties left the
ship, but only with difficulty as the pressure at one hundred and
eighty feet made numerous returns to the torpedo room necessary to
revive prostrate men.

At the time the last party escaped, the forward battery fire
had reached such intensity that paint on the forward torpedo room

- 19 -


================================================================================
PAGE 193
================================================================================

after bulkhead was scorching and running down. Considerable pres-
sure had built up in the forward battery making it difficult to
secure the after torpedo room door sufficiently tight to prevent
acrid smoke from seeping by the gasket. It is felt that this
gasket blew out, either due to the pressure or an ensuing battery
explosion, and that the remaining personnel were asphyxiated.

Of the thirteen men who escaped, five were able to cling to
the buoy until picked up. Three others reached the surface, but
were unable to hang on or breathe and floated off and drowned.
The other five were not seen after leaving the trunk.

Of the nine officers and men on the bridge, three were able
to swim through out the night and until picked up eight hours
later. One officer escaped from the flooded conning tower and
remained afloat until rescued with the aid of his trousers con-
verted to a life belt.

The Destroyer Escort which picked up all nine survivors was
one of four which were rescuing Japanese troops and personnel.
When we realized that our clubbing and kicking were being ad-
ministered by the burned, mutilated survivors of our own handi-
work, we found we could take it with less prejudice.

U.S.S. TANG - FIFTH WAR PATROL.

From: The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet.
To: The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.
Via: The Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Report of Fifth War Patrol
(24 September to 25 October 1944).

1. The fifth war patrol of the U.S.S. TANG, commanded by Commander
R. H. O'Kane, U.S. Navy, was conducted in the Formosa Strait. This report,
written from memory after Commander O'Kane's release from a Japanese prisoner
of war camp, is not as complete or detailed as is customary, nor is it feasible
to obtain division and squadron commanders endorsement of it.

2. The Force Commander considers the fifth patrol of the TANG to
be one of the most brilliant submarine cruises of all time. The TANG relentlessly
carried to the enemy throughout, and in four precisely executed attacks on
enemy ships were destroyed. The first two were unsupported
single ships, but the last two were stirring actions against large, well armed and heavily escorted convoys. Data is
not available on which to base an analysis of these attacks, however, the
[UNCLEAR: fact] that more than a dozen torpedoes fired hit, and one of the remaining
two is known to have run erratic. This performance, especially under the strain of such lively
action as attacks three and four, eloquently bespeaks firm, competent
command, perfect organization and thoroughly drilled fire control parties
and meticulous attention to the details of preservation and
maintenance.

3. The award of the Submarine Combat Insignia for this patrol is
authorized.

4. It was the tragic result of one of the unavoidable risks of
submarine warfare that this gallant ship should be sunk by the malfunctioning
of one of her own torpedoes, and that the last to be fired. The Commander
Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, extends a heartfelt
welcome and his sympathy on the loss of their shipmates. To
the men who manned her he offers his sincere congratulations on a
brilliant patrol during which the following damage was inflicted on the enemy:

From: The Commander Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet.
To : The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.
Via : The Commander in Chief, U. S. Pacific Fleet.

Subject: U.S.S. TANG (SS306) - Loss of.

1. It is with the deepest regret that the Commander
Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, reports that the U.S.S. TANG
is overdue from patrol and must be presumed to be lost.

2. The TANG, under the command of Commander Richard
H. O'Kane, departed Pearl Harbor on 24 September 1944, for
patrol in accordance with Commander Task Force Seventeen Opera-
tion Order No. 320-44. She arrived at Midway on the morning of
27 September, topped off with fuel, and departed that same after-
noon for her patrol area. She has not been heard from since her
departure from Midway.

3. The patrol area assigned the TANG was the area
between the northwestern coast of Formosa and the coast of China.
In order to reach this area the TANG was required to pass
through narrow waters known to be heavily patrolled by the enemy.
There was some question as to whether she would be able
to make this passage, the Commanding Officer was given an alter-
native plan which permitted him at his discretion to join a co-
ordinated attack group, consisting of the SILVERSIDES, TRIGGER
and SALMON, under the command of Commander Coye in SILVERSIDES.
This coordinated group was patrolling off the northeastern coast
of Formosa. The Commanding Officers of these three vessels have
reported that they received no communications from the TANG
during the period of their patrol. The area assigned to the
TANG was at the request of the Commanding Officer of that vessel,
who fully realized the dangers involved. However, it was the
nature of Commander O'Kane to ask for the most difficult assign-
ments and then to carry them out to perfection.

4. Had the TANG departed her area on 8 November 1944,
as specified in her operation order, and proceeded at normal
cruising speed, she would have reached Midway about 18 November
1944. Repeated attempts of this command to raise the TANG by

U.S.S. TANG (SS 306) - Statement of Surviving Commanding Officer, Taken from his
Patrol Report SS306/A16-3 dated 10 September 1945.

INTRODUCTION

This report is compiled from my observation and the stories of the eight other
survivors as related to me at the first opportunity after capture.

The U.S.S. TANG took on board the twenty-four Mark 18 Mod 1 electric torpedoes
prepared for the U.S.S. TAMBOR who was being delayed. All torpedo personnel in the
TANG had attended electric torpedo school and it is assured these torpedoes were
properly routined while on station. In fact, the performance of the first twenty-
three torpedoes in all running perfectly, with twenty-two hits, attests to this.

The last two torpedoes were loaded in tubes three and four during the final
stern tube attack. After pulling clear of the enemy escorts opportunity was avail-
able to spend an hour checking these torpedoes before closing the tubes to sink a
cripple. They were partially withdrawn from the tubes, batteries ventilated, gyro
pots inspected and steering mechanism observed to be operating freely.

With the submarine speed checking at six knots and the ship conned for zero
gyro, the twenty-third torpedo was fired. When its phosphorescent wake was observed
heading for its point of aim on the stopped transport, the last torpedo was fired
from the tube number four. This torpedo curved sharply to the left, broaching during
the first part of its turn and then porpoising during the remainder. Emergency speed
was called for and answered immediately on firing, and a fishtail maneuver partially
completed in an attempt to get clear of the torpedoes turning circle. This resulted
only in the torpedo striking the stern abreast the after torpedo room instead of amid-
ships.

The explosion was very violent, whipping the boat, breaking H.P. air lines, lift-
ing deck plates, etc. Numerous personnel as far forward as the control room received
broken limbs and other injuries. The immediate result to the ship was to flood the
after three compartments together with number six and seven ballast tanks. No one es-
caped from these compartments and even the forward engine room was half flooded before
the after door could be secured.

The ship, with no normal positive buoyancy aft and with three after flooded
compartments, went down instantly by the stern. With personnel in the conning tower
falling aft due to the angle, there was insufficient time to carry
out the order to close the hatch.

Personnel in the control room succeeded in closing the conning tower lower hatch,
but it had been jammed in the explosion and leaked badly. They then leveled the boat
off by flooding number two main ballast tank (opening the vent manually) and proceeded
to the forward torpedo room carrying the injured in blankets.
