#### My goals:

- Minimally, make sure the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) doesn't kill the world of books.
- Maximally, use AGI to shape a world where books are more important, vital, and ubiquitous than ever before.

#### Along the way:
- Pass the critical quality threshold so that some AI- and AI-human collaborative books, matched head-to-head with comparable human books, _are as good as anything ever written by a human_.
- Operate the AI Lab for Book-Lovers where authors can experiment with tools for high-quality book writing.
- Pay for my retirement.

#### How you can help make AGI beneficial for book-lovers:

- let's get acquainted!
