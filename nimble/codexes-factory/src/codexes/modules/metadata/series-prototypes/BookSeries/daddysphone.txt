I have the best daddy.  He's so smart and funny and he plays "Planets" with me.
He swings me from Earth to Venus to Mercury and back out to Pluto.
But I hate his phone.
I hate his phone because it's always ringing and he has to answer it.
I hate his phone because it's the newest on the market.
I hate his phone because it's younger than me.
I hate his phone because it's little and dinky and.
I hate his phone because he loves his phone more than he loves me.
I love my Daddy because he's my Daddy.
But I hate his phone.
I am going to destroy his phone.
But first I am going to tell him I love him.
I love you, Daddy.
But if you don't stop playing with your phone and start playing with me, I am going to destroy your phone.
My Daddy hid his phone in his pocket!
I love my Daddy.
