    prompt = """Generate 3 publishing imprints for BigFiveReplacement LLC focused on puzzles_games category.

CONTEXT: BigFiveReplacement is a virtual "shadow" publisher designed to exceed the Big Five publishers' scale (550+ imprints) and fill the $4.5B revenue gaps they've left.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each imprint needs: name, charter, focus, tagline, target_audience, competitive_advantage, examples
2. Names should be professional, memorable, and category-appropriate
3. Competitive advantages should highlight market gaps or superior positioning
4. Examples should be specific book titles, authors, or series that would fit

STRATEGY FOR PUZZLES_GAMES:
- Focus on underserved profitable niches the Big Five ignore
- This is a $500M+ annual market with only Hachette (Puzzlewright Press) competing
- High margins, recurring purchases, gift market potential

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return as JSON array with this structure:
[
  {
    "name": "Imprint Name",
    "charter": "Brief mission statement",
    "focus": "Specific publishing focus areas",
    "tagline": "Marketing tagline",
    "target_audience": "Primary readership",
    "competitive_advantage": "Why this imprint wins",
    "examples": "Sample titles or authors"
  }
]

Generate exactly 3 unique, high-quality imprints that would collectively dominate the puzzles_games market."""
