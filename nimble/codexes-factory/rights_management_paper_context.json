  "title": "AI-Assisted Rights Management Systems: Technological Innovations and Industry Applications in International Publishing",
  "abstract": "This paper surveys the application of artificial intelligence and algorithmic optimization methods to rights management in the publishing industry, examining current technological implementations, legal frameworks, and emerging applications by major corporations. We analyze the scientific advancements achieved through automated rights tracking, contract optimization, and intelligent document generation systems, with particular focus on international licensing workflows. The research contributes to understanding how AI transforms traditional publishing rights management from manual, error-prone processes to data-driven, scalable automation systems.",
