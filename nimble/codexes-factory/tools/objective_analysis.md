Based on the consolidated specifications and the identified issues, problems, potential conflicts, and regressions, here are the recommended next steps, prioritized to ensure system stability, core functionality, and long-term maintainability:

### Phase 1: Stabilize Core Functionality & Address Critical User-Facing Issues

This phase focuses on resolving immediate blockers and ensuring the fundamental user experience is reliable and predictable.

1.  **Prioritize Streamlit UI Stability (`streamlit-ui-runaway-fixes` and `streamlit-form-button-fix`)**
    *   **Action**: Immediately complete all remaining open tasks in `streamlit-ui-runaway-fixes`. This includes implementing debouncing mechanisms, atomic session state management, preventing validation loops on the Book Pipeline page, comprehensive error handling for UI, and creating unit/integration tests for these managers.
    *   **Rationale**: The recurring "runaway loop" and UI instability issues are critical blockers for a functional user interface. Without a stable UI, efficient configuration and workflow execution are impossible. The completed tasks in `streamlit-form-button-fix` are a good start, but the deeper state management issues persist.

2.  **Finalize Configuration Hierarchy Enforcement & Synchronization (`config-sync-fix` and `frontmatter-backmatter-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**:
        *   Thoroughly test the completed `config-sync-fix` to ensure seamless synchronization between UI selection and core settings, including user overrides and visual indicators.
        *   Complete tasks related to "Configuration Hierarchy Enforcement" in `frontmatter-backmatter-fixes`, including robust testing to confirm `schedule.json` subtitles and `tranche.json` author/imprint correctly override all other configurations.
    *   **Rationale**: Inconsistent configuration application is a root cause of many downstream errors and unpredictable behavior. A fully working and reliably tested configuration system is foundational. The persistence of configuration-related issues across multiple phases highlights its complexity and importance.

3.  **Complete Back Cover Text & Annotation Generation (`llm-back-cover-text-processing` and `cover-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**:
        *   Complete all open tasks in `llm-back-cover-text-processing`, ensuring the LLM reliably generates *final*, *clean* back cover text without variables in Stage 1. This includes updating prompts, integrating into the pipeline, and adding robust validation/fallbacks.
        *   Once `llm-back-cover-text-processing` is verified, complete the remaining tasks in `cover-fixes` to ensure Korean text is processed correctly and the variable substitution logic in `cover_generator.py` is safely removed/simplified.
    *   **Rationale**: Direct impact on final book quality and publishing readiness. The current fragmented approach introduces complexity and potential errors. Streamlining this will improve output reliability and simplify the cover generation component.

4.  **Resolve Core Pricing Fixes (`lsi-pricing-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**: Complete all remaining open tasks in `lsi-pricing-fixes`, specifically implementing the Territorial Price Calculator, fixing Specialty Market Pricing, standardizing Wholesale Discount Formatting, optimizing Field Mapping Strategy Registration, and updating Price Field Mappings. Then, execute the "Comprehensive Pricing Tests."
    *   **Rationale**: Incorrect or missing pricing is a critical business issue for LSI submissions, directly impacting revenue and distribution. This requires immediate resolution.

5.  **Address Remaining LSI CSV Bug Fixes (especially Tranche Config & Batching) (`lsi-csv-bug-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**: Focus on the open tasks in `lsi-csv-bug-fixes` related to "Resolve tranche configuration application issues" and "Implement robust error handling for configuration" (Phase 3). Also, prioritize "Improve batch processing error reporting" and "Optimize memory usage and performance" (Phase 4).
    *   **Rationale**: These are direct acknowledgments of known bugs impacting core functionality and stability during batch operations. Completing these will significantly improve system reliability.

### Phase 2: Enhance Key Features & Improve Output Quality

This phase focuses on completing and refining features that directly impact the quality and completeness of generated book data and content.

1.  **Finalize BISAC Category System (`bisac-category-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**: Complete the open tasks: "Test BISAC category generation with live pipeline," "Add comprehensive error handling and logging," and "Create unit tests for BISAC category system."
    *   **Rationale**: BISAC categories are crucial for book discoverability and LSI acceptance. Ensuring the enhanced generation and validation are fully robust and tested is paramount.

2.  **Complete LSI Field Mapping Corrections (`lsi-field-mapping-corrections`)**
    *   **Action**: Complete the remaining open task: "Update existing tranche configuration files" with `field_overrides`, `blank_fields`, and `file_path_templates`.
    *   **Rationale**: The value of the implemented field mapping corrections (tranche overrides, JSON extraction) depends on properly configured tranche files. This ensures the new logic is actually used and tested in realistic scenarios.

3.  **Solidify ISBN Schedule Assignment (`isbn-schedule-assignment`)**
    *   **Action**: Prioritize completing the open tasks related to error handling, data persistence, Streamlit reporting, and bulk operations. Also, focus on the remaining integration and performance tests.
    *   **Rationale**: This is a major new feature. While core components are in place, robustness (error handling, persistence) and usability (UI for reports, bulk ops) are crucial for its practical adoption and reliability.

4.  **Finish Frontmatter/Backmatter Fixes (`frontmatter-backmatter-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**: Methodically work through all remaining open tasks in this phase. This is critical for overall book quality. Explicitly complete tasks for:
        *   Fixing glossary formatting, cleaning up publisher's note, fixing foreword Korean formatting, and ensuring the mnemonics section appears.
        *   Implementing reprompting for frontmatter sections.
        *   Creating the regression prevention system and comprehensive integration tests.
    *   **Rationale**: This directly impacts the professional appearance and completeness of the final book. The explicit "anti-regression measures" are vital to prevent re-introduction of past issues.

### Phase 3: System Hardening & Long-Term Health

This phase addresses overarching concerns about the system's robustness, maintainability, and future diagnostics.

1.  **Implement Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance**
    *   **Action**: For *every* completed and new feature, ensure the corresponding comprehensive testing suites are fully implemented and regularly run. This includes:
        *   **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components work as expected.
        *   **Integration Tests**: Validate end-to-end workflows across integrated components (especially critical for all "fixed" features).
        *   **Regression Tests**: Specifically target areas that have seen repeated bugs (e.g., config hierarchy, LaTeX escaping, UI stability, pricing, BISAC) to prevent reoccurrence.
        *   **Performance Tests**: Benchmark key operations and identify bottlenecks.
        *   **Validation Tests**: Ensure compliance with LSI and internal quality standards.
    *   **Rationale**: Many "completed" tasks lack corresponding completed testing phases. This is the single biggest risk for future stability. A robust test suite is the only way to confirm fixes and prevent regressions across such a complex, evolving system.

2.  **Ensure Robust Logging & Monitoring (`lsi-field-enhancement-phase4` and `pipeline-configuration-fixes`)**
    *   **Action**: Complete the open tasks related to enhancing the logging system (configurable verbosity, severity filtering, structured format, performance monitoring) in `lsi-field-enhancement-phase4`. Also, ensure comprehensive logging and transparency (logging LLM usage, config values at startup, template substitution) is implemented as per `pipeline-configuration-fixes`.
    *   **Rationale**: High transparency and filterability in logging are essential for diagnosing issues, especially in a system prone to complex interactions and subtle bugs.

3.  **Update All Documentation**
    *   **Action**: Complete all remaining "Update Documentation" tasks across all specification directories. This includes user guides, API references, troubleshooting guides, and documentation for new features and fixed components. Pay special attention to documenting "locked" components and anti-regression measures.
    *   **Rationale**: Clear, up-to-date documentation is paramount for developer onboarding, system maintenance, and user support, especially with the fragmented nature of the past development.

By following these prioritized steps, the project can systematically address its technical debt, stabilize core functionalities, enhance product quality, and build a more robust and maintainable system for the future.
