  "synopsis": "Mateo Garcia-Chen lives for the thrill of landing a new skateboarding trick. He spends hours practicing kickflips and ollies, fueled by his dream of going viral with a new skateboarding video. But in Ms. Davies's class, where the new 'Science of Reading' curriculum emphasizes systematic phonics, Mateo finds himself constantly falling. Decoding feels like an endless series of small, frustrating failures, making him want to give up. His mom, a former 'balanced literacy' enthusiast, worries the new methods are too rigid, while his stepdad, a data analyst, trusts the school's research-backed approach. This creates tension at home, as they try to help Mateo.",
  "character_arc": "Mateo starts as a child who understands grit in physical challenges but not academic ones. He learns that the same perseverance he applies to skateboarding can be used to master reading, by breaking down challenges and celebrating small victories. His journey helps his parents bridge their understanding of different reading approaches, moving from debate to a unified, informed support system for Mateo.",
  "thematic_message": "The grit and perseverance required to master a challenging physical skill like skateboarding are the same emotional muscles children need to build reading resilience. For families, understanding the 'why' behind structured literacy helps them become informed and consistent partners in their child's learning journey.",
  "target_audience_appeal": "Appeals to active, progressive families who value both physical activity and informed educational choices. It addresses the common parental tension between familiar and new teaching methods, providing clarity on SoR, and demonstrating how real-world perseverance can translate to academic success.",
