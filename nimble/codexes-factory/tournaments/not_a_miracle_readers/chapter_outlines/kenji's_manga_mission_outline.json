She learns about 'structured literacy' vs. 'balanced literacy,' understanding that explicit, systematic instruction in 'phonemic awareness,' 'phonics,' 'fluency,' 'vocabulary,' and 'comprehension' is crucial. She realizes learning to read isn't natural for everyone and how 'diagnostic and responsive teaching' helps. The workshop also emphasizes the 'link between literacy and mental health,' connecting to Kenji's past anxiety. Dr. Tanaka feels a mix of regret for her past dismissiveness and empowerment from her new knowledge. She buys a simple set of letter tiles and a decodable book for home practice, ready to support Kenji with 'patience' and a 'growth mindset.'",
