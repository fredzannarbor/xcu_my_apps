Initially intrigued by the sleek tablet and instant feedback, Liam quickly finds ReadBot's relentless decoding drills and 'perfect score' metrics unsettling. He struggles to keep up with the pace, feeling like a 'glitch' in the system when his scores don't match the immediate success of his classmates. At home, his software engineer parents, who value data and efficiency, praise ReadBot, unknowingly adding to Liam's internal pressure. Liam finds solace and genuine confidence only in his after-school coding club, where he's secretly building a silly meme generator.",
