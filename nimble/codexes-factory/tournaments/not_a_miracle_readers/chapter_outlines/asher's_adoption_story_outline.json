But instead of shutting down, he takes a deep breath, remembering his strategies. He starts his presentation, showing his 'Day in the Life of a Ferret' TikTok. Midway through, a technical glitch causes his video to freeze. Asher feels a surge of panic, but this time, he manages it. He calmly explains the situation, improvises, and continues his presentation using his notes, highlighting key facts about ferret care and why they make great pets. His parents watch, beaming with pride, not just for his facts, but for his poise."
