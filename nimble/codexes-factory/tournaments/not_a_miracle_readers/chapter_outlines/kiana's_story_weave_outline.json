Sarah, a librarian, shows Kiana her new bedroom, which features a small, empty bookshelf. Kiana, who loves oral storytelling and has a vivid imagination, feels a pang of longing for the stories she usually carries in her mind, and imagines sharing them on a platform like BookTok. During dinner, Sarah reads aloud from a Cherokee folktale, which Kiana adores. However, when Sarah gently asks Kiana about her reading at school, Kiana deflects, hinting at past disruptions and a lack of consistent reading practice.",
