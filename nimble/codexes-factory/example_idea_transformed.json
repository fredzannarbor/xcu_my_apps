Her life takes a dramatic turn after an encounter with a mysterious old woman who gifts her a peculiar pocket watch. Unknown to Jane, the watch possesses the power to travel back in time.\n\nJane accidentally discovers this power when she's investigating a cold case involving a serial killer dubbed as \"The Timekeeper\" who left antique watches at each crime scene. As she examined the last watch left by the killer, she finds herself in the past, witnessing the murder as it happened. She realizes that she can now travel back in time to witness crimes firsthand.\n\nHowever, Jane quickly understands the rules of her newfound ability: her actions in the past can influence the future, and changing too much can create dangerous paradoxes that threaten to unravel reality itself. This is evident when Jane, in an attempt to prevent a murder, accidentally alters her timeline causing her trusted partner, Detective Ryan, to vanish from existence.\n\nWhile trying to undo her actions, she discovers that she's not the only one with the ability to time travel. The Timekeeper is revealed to be another time-traveler who, contrary to Jane, exploits the power to commit his heinous crimes. The Timekeeper is aware of Jane's actions and begins to manipulate her attempts to fix the timeline to his advantage, creating more paradoxes and destabilizing reality further.\n\nJane must now navigate through the complex web of time, solving cases in both the past and the present while trying to stop the Timekeeper. She also has to keep her secret from her colleagues at the police station, who are growing suspicious of her ability to solve cases with uncanny precision. \n\nJane finds herself in a race against time - she must stop the Timekeeper, restore the original timeline, and save her partner Ryan from non-existence. Along the way, she must grapple with the moral implications of her power and the damage that manipulating time can cause. Her journey forces her to redefine her understanding of justice, responsibility, and the true cost of altering fate.\n\n'Paradox Prey' is a thrilling science fiction tale that explores the precarious balance between power and responsibility, the complexity of time, and the relentless pursuit of justice.",
