Chapters focus on major Nativity events, with varied quote lengths. The style should seem very modern. Model yourself after popular oral histories like LIVE FROM NEW YORK by Tom Shales; WORKING by Studs Terkel; LOOSE BALLS by Terry Pluto; VOICES FROM CHERNOBYL by Svetlana Alexievich; THE FIFTY-YEAR MISSION by Mark Altman; and WHEN THE SEA CAME ALIVE by Garrett M. Graff.",

Divide the book into 6 chapters, each ~10,000 words, covering major events from the prophecies to the Temple presentation (Isaiah 7:14, Micah 5:2, Luke 1:5–2:38, Matthew 1:18–2:12). For each chapter, list: title, description, biblical references, 3–5 specific scenes (distinct moments or events), and 5–7 speakers (from major figures, minor characters, prophetic voices, antagonistic figures, or celestial beings). For each speaker, specify their context (stylized afterlife setting), 1–3 quotes (sentence, paragraph, or passage), and the specific event or moment they address. Ensure quotes vary in length, reflect witty, fresh, respectful tones, and weave a cohesive narrative. The quotations should focus more on the events and third parties that the speaker is describing and less on  speaker's own emotions.  Output as a JSON object with a ‘chapters’ array."
