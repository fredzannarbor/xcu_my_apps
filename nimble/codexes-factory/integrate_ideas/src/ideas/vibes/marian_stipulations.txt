## 1. All Bible Verses Mentioning or Including Mary

While not every reference describes her in detail, these are the principal passages where Mary (the mother of Jesus) is mentioned or appears in the New Testament. (Verses in the Old Testament that are sometimes linked to Mary are more typological or prophetic rather than explicit references.)

### Gospel of Matthew
- **Matthew 1:16** – Introduces Mary in Jesus’s genealogy (“…Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born…”).
- **Matthew 1:18–25** – The account of the Annunciation to Joseph concerning the virginal conception.
- **Matthew 2:11** – The Magi visit the child Jesus and Mary.
- **Matthew 12:46–50** – Mary (and other family members) seek to speak to Jesus.
- **Matthew 13:55** – People of Nazareth refer to “the carpenter’s son” and mention Mary as his mother.

### Gospel of Mark
- **Mark 3:31–35** – Mary and relatives come looking for Jesus.
- **Mark 6:3** – Locals of Nazareth question Jesus’s identity, referring to Him as “the son of Mary.”

### Gospel of Luke
- **Luke 1:26–38 (The Annunciation)** – Gabriel announces to Mary she will conceive by the Holy Spirit.

### Pauline Epistles
- **Galatians 4:4** – Paul references Christ’s birth from a woman, but does not name Mary explicitly.

### Book of Revelation
- **Revelation 12** – Some Christian traditions (especially Catholic) interpret the “woman clothed with the sun” as a symbolic representation of Mary (among other layers of meaning). The text itself does not name her as Mary, so this passage is often used typologically.

## 2. Textual Support for the Immaculate Conception

The doctrine of the **Immaculate Conception** teaches that from the first instant of her existence, Mary was preserved free from the stain of original sin, by a singular grace and privilege of God. It was definitively dogmatized by Pope Pius IX in the Apostolic Constitution *Ineffabilis Deus* (1854). Below are the key biblical and historical references often cited:

### A. Biblical Passages Often Linked to Mary’s Sinlessness

1. **Genesis 3:15** (the “Protoevangelium”)
   - God says to the serpent: “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers…”
   - In Catholic tradition, this is seen as the first foreshadowing of a Redeemer (Christ) and His mother (“the woman”). The term “enmity” is interpreted to mean a total opposition between Mary and sin (serpent).

2. **Luke 1:28 (“Hail, full of grace!”)**
   - The angel Gabriel greets Mary as “κεχαριτωμένη” (kecharitōmenē), often translated “full of grace” or “highly favored.”
   - Proponents argue that the perfect passive participle suggests a permanent state of having been graced by God, supporting the idea that Mary was uniquely free from sin.

3. **Luke 1:41–42 (“Blessed are you among women…”)**
   - Elizabeth’s inspired greeting underscores Mary’s special blessedness and unique role.

While none of these passages explicitly spell out “Mary was conceived without original sin,” Catholic theology sees in these verses strong hints of Mary’s unique holiness and total separateness from sin.

### B. Early Christian Writings and Fathers

1. **Patristic References to Mary as the “New Eve”**
   - Writers like St. Justin Martyr (2nd cent.) and St. Irenaeus (2nd cent.) compared Mary’s obedience to Eve’s disobedience.
   - This “New Eve” typology contributed to the idea that just as Eve was created sinless yet fell, Mary, through Christ’s grace, remained sinless.

2. **Origen (early 3rd cent.)**
   - Spoke of Mary as holy and emphasized her unique role, though explicit language about Immaculate Conception was not yet developed.

3. **St. Ambrose (4th cent.) and St. Augustine (4th–5th cent.)**
   - Both stressed Mary’s holiness and freedom from personal sin. Augustine, in particular, famously excluded Mary from the discussion of sin when writing on original sin (*De natura et gratia,* ch. 42).

4. **Later Medieval Theologians**
   - Debates intensified about whether Mary ever contracted original sin.
   - **St. Bernard of Clairvaux** (12th cent.) expressed doubts about celebrating Mary’s conception.
   - **St. Thomas Aquinas** (13th cent.) hesitated on the timing of Mary’s sanctification.
   - **Bl. John Duns Scotus** (13th–14th cent.) provided the most rigorous theological foundation, arguing that Mary could be redeemed preemptively by Christ’s merits, thereby never contracting original sin.

### C. Magisterial and Liturgical Developments

1. **Feast of the Conception of Mary**
   - In the Eastern Church, the Feast of the Conception of St. Anne (Mary’s mother) was celebrated early on (documented by the 8th or 9th century).
   - In the Western Church, this became the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, spreading widely in the Middle Ages.

2. **Papal and Conciliar Endorsements**
   - Although not dogmatically defined until 1854, the belief was widely held in Catholic devotion.
   - Pope Sixtus IV (1476) approved the liturgical texts for the Feast of the Conception of Mary while cautioning theologians not to condemn differing opinions on the Immaculate Conception.
   - **Ineffabilis Deus (1854)** by Pope Pius IX formally defined the Immaculate Conception as dogma.

## 3. Strongest Traditions Relating to the Immaculate Conception

Below are the key traditions and historical developments that shaped the doctrine and solidified its place in Catholic teaching:

1. **Early Feast in the East**
   - The Christian East celebrated the “Conception of the Theotokos by Saint Anne” (December 9 in many Eastern calendars). Although the Eastern Orthodox Church does not share exactly the same understanding as Roman Catholics, the feast testifies to an early reverence for Mary’s sinlessness and extraordinary holiness.

2. **“New Eve” Teaching in the Early Church**
   - From the 2nd century onward, Mary’s role as the New Eve was central: Eve cooperated in sin and death entering the world; Mary cooperates in salvation by bringing forth Christ. This theological typology created a strong impetus toward seeing Mary as free from sin’s dominion.

3. **Medieval Scholastic Development**
   - The strongest theological articulation emerged with Franciscan theologian **Bl. John Duns Scotus**. He reasoned that God, foreseeing the salvific merits of Christ’s sacrifice, could apply them “in advance” to Mary at her conception, preventing her from ever contracting original sin.

4. **Popular Devotion and Piety**
   - Medieval and Renaissance-era piety emphasized Mary’s purity—hymns, prayers, and artwork portrayed Mary as the “all-pure.”
   - This widespread popular devotion set the stage for official acceptance: the faithful had long venerated Mary under titles like “Immaculate Mother” before the doctrine was dogmatically defined.

5. **Proclamation of the Dogma (1854)**
   - By the time Pope Pius IX issued *Ineffabilis Deus,* the belief was almost universally held within the Catholic Church. The definition formalized what had long been celebrated liturgically and taught by many prominent theologians.

6. **Further Confirmation at Lourdes (1858)**
   - Four years after the dogma’s definition, St. Bernadette Soubirous reported Marian apparitions at Lourdes, during which Mary introduced herself as the “Immaculate Conception.” While a private revelation, Catholics often see it as a kind of divine confirmation of the dogma.

### Summary

- **Biblical mentions of Mary** center on the Gospels, Acts, a reference in Galatians, and a symbolic passage in Revelation.
- **Textual support for the Immaculate Conception** comes primarily from typological and linguistic interpretations (Gen 3:15; Luke 1:28) plus a long theological and devotional tradition culminating in the 1854 dogmatic proclamation.
- **Strongest traditions** include the New Eve motif in early Christianity, medieval debates and clarifications (especially by Duns Scotus), a widespread feast in East and West, and eventual papal dogmatic definition.

These elements, taken together, comprise the Catholic Church’s foundational basis for Mary’s unique role and sinless conception. While Christians outside the Catholic (and some High Anglican) tradition may not affirm the Immaculate Conception in the same way, understanding these texts and historical developments is key to seeing why it remains a central Marian doctrine in Roman Catholicism.
