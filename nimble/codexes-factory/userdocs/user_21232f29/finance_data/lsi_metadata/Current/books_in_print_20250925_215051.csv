<p>This isn't science fiction; it's the precipice of modern neuroscience. ""Memory Enhancement: Recall vs. Rewrite"" by the AI Lab for Book-Lovers plunges into the profound dilemma at the heart of our identity: should we strive for perfect recall  or embrace the power to rewrite our personal histories? This groundbreaking book explores the cutting-edge advancements in memory augmentation and cognitive enhancement  inviting readers to confront the exhilarating and terrifying implications of manipulating the very fabric of our past.</p>

<p>Drawing on insights from leading neuroscientists  this book dissects the intricate biological mechanisms of memory formation  consolidation  and reconsolidation-from synaptic changes to neural prostheses. It delves into the latest techniques  including pharmacological interventions  brain stimulation (rTMS  tDCS)  optogenetics  and the emerging potential of neural interfaces. But with the power to enhance comes the peril of manipulation. ""Memory Enhancement"" confronts the chilling implications of false memories  the ethical tightrope walk between 'therapeutic recall' and 'memory rewriting ' and the societal anxieties surrounding non-medical cognitive enhancement. It asks: what is the fidelity of memory  and what are the moral boundaries of altering it?</p>

<p>From the dystopian visions of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" to the intimate anxieties of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Black Mirror "" our cultural narratives have long grappled with altered memories. This book bridges the gap between speculative fiction and scientific reality  examining how concepts like ""postmemory"" and ""consensual hallucination"" are already shaping our perception of self in the digital age. What happens when social media curates our pasts  or when ""memories you can buy"" become a reality? It challenges us to consider what defines 'you' when your memories can be externalized  transferred  or even implanted  echoing the profound questions posed by ""Ghost in the Shell"" about the nature of the self.</p>

<p>Published by Nimble Books LLC  ""Memory Enhancement: Recall vs. Rewrite"" is an indispensable guide for anyone fascinated by the brain  technology  and the future of human identity.

The torpedo  then as now  is the ultimate close-range weapon for sinking ships; a mission that remains essential today.
This book  published in 1890 by the United States Naval Torpedo Station (Newport  R.I.)  was a comprehensive guide on how to connect  prime  and test spar torpedoes; fill them with gun-cotton; connect the wires using circuit-closers  and more.  Spar torpedoes were attached to a spar on the bow of the ship and meant to detonate on contact with an enemy. Needless to say  the nature of the weapon presupposed that it would be deployed. By bold and skillful seamen.
In this manual readers will discover a detailed overview of torpedo technology as well as helpful instructions for every stage of handling these powerful weapons. The step-by-step approach makes it easy to understand even complex topics like wiring diagrams and primers that may be too confusing otherwise. The US Naval Torpedo Station experts provided their expertise on topics that range from basic torpedo assembly checkout procedures all the way up to intricate explosion mechanisms. 
This document reflects well on the technical capabilities of the US Navy at the end of the 19th Century. But it also sheds light on the requirements for naval success at the beginning of the 21st Century.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS",,"With Russian officials and political leaders explicitly threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons in their war with Ukraine  it is worth re-examining the lessons learned about tactical nuclear weapons during the Cold War. This illuminating report on the proposed use of tactical nuclear weapons in Southeast Asia was written in 1967 by a four-man team from the JASON scientific advisory committee  including Freeman J. Dyson. This groundbreaking work examines the potential consequences had tactical nuclear weapons been utilized during the Vietnam War. It examines a range of topics including arms control  targeting strategies  and the potential effects of nuclear war on civilian populations. The authors take a comprehensive approach to their subject matter and provide valuable insights into how these weapons could have been used in Southeast Asia had they been available. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the complex nature of tactical nuclear weapons as well as their potential consequences in modern warfare. It provides a fascinating look at one of history's most explosive topics and offers important lessons for today's conflicts involving TNWs. Most notably  much larger numbers of warhead uses would be required than most modern commentators are even imagining.  The reason is that tactical military units are small  well dispersed  and difficult to target. The JASON team found an estimate of 10 weapons/day  or 3000 year  to be plausible.

The Soviet Union's doctrine of night attack  or """"nochnoy udar """" was a key component of the Soviet military's ability to achieve surprise and shock in the early stages of a conflict.  This report is a comprehensive case study of the Soviet doctrine of night attack  including its development  its application  and its impact on the battlefield.  It is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of armored warfare  the Soviet and Russian armies  and the history of the modern battlefield.

Soviet ground force tactical units conducted night attacks in  accordance with a theoretical model that lasted through the Cold War. Its salient characteristics were pre-battle reconnaissance  attack from the march  dismounted assault  illumination  patrolling  commitment of a second echelon  and penetration of the defending brigade reserve positions by dawn. Demonstrated Soviet tactical unit deficiencies in executing nhe bight attack included land navigation and terrain orientation  driving  and use of night vision devices. Theoretical vulnerabilities which were identifed include over reliance on illumination  predictibility of combat reconnaissance patrols  and physical exhaustion of Soviet troops.  Actual experience in Ukraine has demonstrated the existence of these deficiences and more.

The report includes a thorough bibliography based on the Russian sources.

This 2009 report by a US Air Force major attending the Air Command And Staff College Air University sets out the case for equipping US balloons with smart bombs.  From the author's abstract:

Since the advent of aviation  aircraft have migrated from intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance
(ISR) to weapons platforms. Balloons  airplanes  and UAVs all began as a means to observe the battlefield 
but were later armed in order to attack the observed enemy. The DOD currently seeks stratospheric
airships that could serve as persistent ISR platforms... Like their forerunners in other
wars  stratospheric airships could become weaponized stratospheric airship (WSA). [The paper explores] two wartime scenarios: the
low-intensity conflict of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the near-peer conventional conflict of a Chinese
invasion of Taiwan. The paper will show that even though limited numbers of munitions  significant
munitions replenishment time  and low CAS mission situational awareness hamper the WSA concept  it
should still be pursued ... because it provides a persistent  survivable  and cost effective mechanism of dropping
munitions over a battlefield.""""

It explores the ways in which NIH and its viral research grant awardee EcoHealth Alliance have failed to comply with Federal requirements leading to unallowable costs and an unsatisfactory compliance rate.

This book was written by the highly knowledgeable staff at HHS's OIG whose expertise spans across federal oversight as well as compliance. With decades of experience working on high profile audits related to disruptive healthcare technologies among other topics  they are aware like no other how government oversight is essential for public health research initiatives. This book outlines precisely why it is necessary for stakeholders to ensure effective monitoring.

I urge readers interested in governmental accountability to pick up this timely book today! It offers insight into how transparency within these processes can help us lead healthier lives. Smarter investment of research funds will provide maximum benefits as efficiently as possible.

It's a story of frustration  failure  and accountability: Follow this enthralling drama as it plays out in the pages of OIG audit findings  which  admittedly
are  sometmes  a bit lacking in sizzle. It becomes easier to pay attention when you remember that the failure to monitor grant awards in Wuhan contributed to a the release of a global pandemic that at this printing has already killed seven million people.

Dr. James Tritten ably articulated the value of naval doctrine in this historical survey for the Naval Doctrine Command. In subsequent decades  USN doctrine evolved in response to changing circumstances  in some instances successfully  in some instances not. The USN abandoned long-distance strike aircraft in a doctrinal pursuit of sorties-to-shore  wasted decades on a Littoral Combat Ship that was almost literally all doctrine  and saw its seakeeping readiness degrade at a level even more fundamental than the doctrinal. Today  the US Navy is faced with an existential threat from a peer competitor that can outrange it  outshoot it  and outbuild it. Getting naval doctrine right has never been more critical. Understanding its history is a necessary first step that will repay investment for anyone interested in American sea power: that is  American national power.

Conclusion",,"The next naval war in the Pacific will likely involve significant ship losses for the US Navy  which will immediately raise the question asked by the authors in the Executive Summary to this document: ""what is the best approach to acquiring a large number of warships in an emergency?"" The document compares two approaches: 1) building more of a proven design 2) building a simplified emergency design.  The authors examine a total of 1 345 ships (327 for World War I and 1 018 for World War II) that were built in response to war emergencies.  Crucially  it finds that that ""the simplified design of emergency escorts does not markedly decrease the time needed for those ships to first enter service compared to destroyers.""  This assessment bears careful consideration because as the US defense establishment contemplates a future in which its ship building capacity is outpaced by China  there is a great temptation to look for shortcuts: ""we can offset losses by building lots of drones"" or ""replicators.""

This document provides information about the construction of destroyers  destroyer escorts  and patrol frigates during World War I and World War II. It discusses the strategic background  design decisions  construction challenges  and the importance of quickly producing large numbers of ships to meet the demands of wartime. The document includes details on the shipyards involved  the number of ships built  and the average time it took to build and commission each type of ship. It also highlights the shortages of materials and the impact they had on the construction process. Overall  the document emphasizes the significance of experienced shipyards in achieving rapid production rates and supporting the war effort.

At Point Loma in California  the US Navy continues to train and operate sea lions and bottlenose dolphins to find and mark undersea objects.  In 2019  a beluga whale wearing a Russian harness turned up in Sweden (it is named Hvaldimir) and has continued to return to Nordic waters.  And in 2023  orcas in the Mediterranean began  apparently on their own initiative  to learn a helpful new cultural behavior  sinking yachts.

This document is a compilation of research papers and reports on various topics related to marine mammals  with a focus on dolphins and whales. The topics covered include the anatomy and physiology of their auditory system  echolocation abilities  sound production and reception  target detection and discrimination  and the use of echolocation for navigation and communication. The document also discusses the sensory capabilities  diving behavior  reproductive biology  and other physiological adaptations of marine mammals. It provides insights into the biology  behavior  and health of these animals  as well as techniques and methods used in their study and management. Additionally  the document includes information on the distribution  abundance  migration patterns  general behavior  and sound production of bowhead whales and gray whales  as well as the feeding patterns and habitat preferences of bowhead whales.

INITIAL DISTRIBUTION LIST",,"In the words of the author    from the end of World War I  to the onset of World War II """"the U.S. went from a force that was unsuccessful operating close to the coast to one that was very successful operating in the great distances of the Pacific Ocean.""""  The submarine force was an equal war-winning partner in the campaign against Japan  and this outcome can in large part be traced to the decisions of the General Board of the Navy on submarine design during the interwar period.

This document is a Master's thesis titled """"The Impact of the General Board of the Navy on Interwar Submarine Design"""" by LCDR Jeffrey K. Juergens. The thesis examines the role of the General Board of the Navy in shaping submarine design between World War One and World War Two. It analyzes improvements in submarine offensive armament  propulsion  endurance  and habitability using transcripts of the General Board's meetings. The thesis highlights the significant improvement of the United States submarine force during the interwar period and its impact on Japan's war efforts in World War Two.

Unfortunately  one of the leading recommendations has been overtaken by time. The authors found that """"a distributed barrier of active sensors placed and maintained by a Littoral Combat Ship provided an effective detection and engagement solution.""""  The basic idea of deploying a barrier of active sensors still sounds good  but it won't be the LCS that is deploying them.

This document is a report on the Improved Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Effectiveness project conducted by the Newport cohort of the Naval Postgraduate School. The objective of the project was to address the need for improved ASW effectiveness in protecting a Carrier Strike Group (CSG) during operations. The report outlines the application of a Systems Engineering Design Process (SEDP) to analyze the problem  identify potential solutions  and evaluate them based on measures of effectiveness and performance. The report also includes a detailed description of the needs analysis phase  which involved stakeholder analysis  affinity diagramming  and Pareto analysis to identify the key stakeholder needs and constraints. The report concludes with a recommendation for an alternative solution that combines the use of a barrier of buoys deployed by a Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) with advanced capability improvements to the platform-based active sonar.

In recent years the Navy and the Marine Corps seem to have abandoned the idea of ever risking a large-scale amphibious assault opposed by precision-guided missiles  but that does not mean mine warfare is no longer relevant to the expeditionary community. The new Navy/Marine doctrines for war in the Pacific still envisage many troop-bearing transits through contested and quite possibly mined waters  and the """"pacing threat"""" of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would almost certainly involve a large amphibious assault where US mines might play an important role.

This document is a thesis that examines the effects of sea mining on amphibious warfare. It includes case studies of amphibious assaults conducted at Gallipoli  Normandy  Wonsan  and the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm. The study analyzes the forces involved  the mining conducted  and the impact of mining and mine countermeasures on the achievement of surprise in the assault. The study concludes that force levels are crucial for the success of amphibious assaults  with adequate force levels leading to successful operations. It also emphasizes the importance of rapid and complete mine countermeasures to achieve surprise in amphibious assaults. The document provides historical context  discusses the strategic and operational considerations of amphibious warfare  and highlights the significance of mine warfare in amphibious operations.

With the Russian invasion of Ukraine  the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO  and Putin's belligerent comments about the need to reinforce Russia's northern border  these concerns are once again highly relevant. A Russian command confronting a multinational coalition in the Far North must seriously consider the use of deep strike with special forces to even the playing field early in a war.

This document provides detailed information about the activities and operations of Soviet naval reconnaissance detachments during World War II. The detachments were special operations forces that conducted various missions  including raids  long-range reconnaissance  and sabotage activities. They faced challenges such as harsh weather conditions  German opposition  and coordination issues with other forces. The document highlights the importance of athletic prowess  political loyalty  and foreign language skills in the recruitment and selection process. It also mentions the involvement of covert intelligence agents and foreign nationals in the operations. Overall  the document emphasizes the bravery and resourcefulness of the reconnaissance detachments in carrying out their missions and provides valuable insights into the organization and experiences of Soviet naval special purpose forces during the war.

It is unable to protect even US-flagged shipping in the Red Sea from attacks by a well-armed faction of rebels in one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. In the Pacific  the USN  faces a Chinese Navy that is growing rapidly  powered by Chinese shipbuilding capacity that outmasses the US 200:1. Meanwhile  national strategy imposes the new and  frankly  orthogonal  requirement that the Department of Defense  the world's largest single emitter  should be at net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  These circumstances make the following 2022 thesis by ten students at the Naval War College essential  if teeth-grinding  reading.
From it  the climate-change-conscious reader may hope to:
-	Gain valuable insights into strategies and technologies for achieving net zero emissions in the Navy by 2050  aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.
-	Understand the potential impact of alternative fuels  hydrogen  batteries  and renewable energy on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Navy  addressing the urgent need for sustainability and clean energy solutions.
-	Connect with current public concerns about climate change and the transition to a more sustainable future by exploring the Navy's efforts to reduce emissions  contribute to national and international climate action  and lead the way in decarbonizing operations.
The navalist reader  most concerned with the Navy getting places on time  spending its money on war-fighting  and emerging victorious from conflict  may find the experience more frustrating-but still essential  as the logic demanding reduction in emissions is ineluctable.

In a previous era  NASA  relying on ""engineering judgment""  initially estimated the risk of loss of the space shuttle at between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 100 000; the actual rate was 2 in 133  both with complete loss of vessel and crew.  For this reason  this 2023 presentation from a joint NASA/NRO conference on recent spacecraft mission anomalies should be essential reading for all practitioners.  Readers should expect to:
-	Gain valuable insights into recent spacecraft anomalies and failures  providing a deeper understanding of the challenges and risks associated with space operations.
-	Understand the importance of safety measures and continuous improvement in space technology  particularly in the current era of increasing space exploration and commercial space activities.
-	Recognize the significance of space situational awareness  space weather monitoring  and robust space debris mitigation strategies in addressing the growing number of satellites and debris in orbit.

Re-Reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,9781608881383,1608881385,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Davis, Graeme",,,Author,,,,,,FIC009000,FICTION / Fantasy / General,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Re-reading 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' provides an insightful commentary which takes readers through the novel. It looks at such areas as literary quality  character analysis and plot analysis  while showing that the novel is contextualised within the British culture which informs it. There's plenty for Harry Potter fans in its attention to detail and examination of theories  plot holes and more. J K Rowling's excellence as a writer is explored alongside her occasional shortcomings. Structured in a fun and lighthearted manner  the book gives each chapter a start rating  and assessment includes a look at the heroes and villains in each. Yet it is also a step towards serious literary criticism of the novel  based on the view that the Harry Potter stories should be treated as quality literature.<P>

This book is presented to those re-reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as a prompt for serious consideration of the novel as a work of literature. Inevitably you will agree with much and disagree with much that is written here - that is the nature of literary criticism - but the process of agreeing and disagreeing develops a more considered critical response. Certainly literary criticism is needed. For a book which has received the massive sales of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (15 000 000 copies in the first twenty-four hours alone) there has so far been amazingly little proper criticism published. This book may be regarded as an early contribution to the literary criticism of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.<P>


Demonstrating that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a polished work by a highly skilled writer  this book suggests that it can stand alongside established works of literature. It offers to adult readers as much as it does to the young adults and children that were its first audience  and as such it has the potential to become a true literary classic. The novel's position in global culture is set out and the moral values of the novel are explored  including Harry's role as a Christian hero. Re-reading 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' aims to develop your appreciation of a remarkable novel.<P>",,,B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,166,,N,,30-Jun-12,3-May-13,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,23.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,17.99,,16.32,17.99,17.99,17.99,16.32,16.32,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

This thesis suggests what existingcommercially available UUV system architectural attributes could be used now in U.S. Navy applications. After a survey of multiple existing commercial UUV systems  five of the prevalent systems in the marketplace were selected for analysis and comparison of their system architecture. This thesis included a comprehensive architectural analysis on seven specific architectural attributes of these UUV systems. Other UUV systems were also analyzed to support specific system architecture discussion. Major architecture considerations were made by the UUV system designers and likely drivers of existing system attributes were discussed as well as the benefits and disadvantages of these system attributes. Finally  based on the material and findings of the thesis  recommendations for a notional UUV system design and architecture for the U.S. Navy was presented.,,,Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,150,,N,,26-Apr-13,15-May-13,25.99,19.99,32.99,23.99,34.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,25.99,,23.99,25.99,25.99,25.99,23.99,23.99,25.99,25.99,25.99,25.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

<p>
The naval war of 1939-1945 was a long and bitter struggle fought in every ocean  on  below and above the sea. It resonates with famous names like Midway  Bismarck  Guadalcanal  and the Battle of the Atlantic. This collection of articles previously published in national magazines including World War II  Tin Can Sailor  and Pacific War explores some less famous episodes in the naval war including naval actions fought in the Indian Ocean  the Mediterranean  the South China Sea  and the English Channel  between the naval forces of France  Thailand  Italy  Poland  Germany  Japan  and of course  the U.S. and Royal navies. 
<p>
The Royal Navy's Revenge includes the title action  the last surface battle of the war between British destroyers and a former nemesis of the Royal Navy  the Japanese heavy cruiser Haguro. The story of the U.S. Navy's first surface action against the Japanese  a victory won off the coast of Borneo by four World War I era destroyers is included.  The book also contains self-contained and fast-paced accounts of naval actions fought between Italy and Germany  France and Great Britain  and the Battle of Koh-Chang  between France and Thailand.  It also has an account of a mystery battle between German and American destroyers that has escaped the notice of historians until recently  the story of the defiant German flotilla that held out in the English Channel until the very end of the war and the little known naval campaign fought off the coast of Syria between Vichy France and naval forces from Great Britain  Australia  and New Zealand.

development) to identify potential laser types for employment on the Navy ship. In addition  plausible operational scenarios of suicide attacks by multiple (up to three) small and fast motor boats equipped with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) against LCS-class ships are drawn up. These provide input parameters for computation of the required laser parameters to neutralize such threats. Based on the chosen laser technology and the calculated laser parameters  the requirements for employment of the laser weapon system on a Navy ship are determined.",,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,88,,N,,7-May-13,7-May-13,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,16,17.99,17.99,17.99,16,16,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

But it is far from being a mere historical novel. It stands at the brink of literature and research  an approach which was essential to emphasize differences in tactics  attitudes  characters and philosophies. Guderian and Zhukov were the new archetypes of a modernized military philosophy and the brand new war doctrines by which modern leaders rule their generals and modern nations fight their wars.

"Small Combatants for the Homeland Mission: Littoral Combat Ships, Frigates, and Corvettes",9781608880034,1608880036,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Brown, Andrew M.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,,,,,PageKicker Corporation,,,,,,"This thesis examines how the composition of the U.S. fleet  with specific focus on small combatants  affects the ability of the United States Navy to undertake homeland defense missions and provides suggestions to improve its core competency. 

Currently  the U.S. Navy relies on a shrinking group of aging Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates to conduct counterpiracy  counter-narcotics  counter maritime insurgency  and maritime engagement missions. The large warships that make up the rest of the fleet are able to undertake these missions  but their cost and capabilities make them better suited for other operations. This thesis examines the proposed Littoral Combat Ship but argues that it is not the ideal ship: it is too expensive  too vulnerable  and undermanned  and it has a modular concept that is too underdeveloped for practical naval operations. Instead  this thesis proposes that the U.S. Navy would be better served by procuring a traditional frigate or corvette to accomplish the variety of missions that fall under the umbrella of homeland defense. Such a traditional small combatant would provide the U.S. Navy with a warship capable of conducting traditional fleet operations as well as operating at the lower end of the spectrum of operations",,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,104,,N,,7-Jun-13,7-Jun-13,16.99,12.99,20.99,14.99,21.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,16.99,,15,16.99,16.99,16.99,15,15,16.99,16.99,16.99,16.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

As Escobar tells it in the introduction  ""the columns selected for this volume follow the period 2009-2014 - the Obama years so far. A continuum with previous volumes published by Nimble Books does apply. Globalistan  from 2007  was an extended reportage/warped travel book across the Bush years  where I argued the world was being plunged into Liquid War - alluding to energy flows but also to the liquid modernity character of post-modern war. Red Zone Blues  also from 2007  was a vignette - an extended reportage centering on the Baghdad surge. And Obama does Globalistan  from 2009  examined how the hyperpower could embark on a ""change we can believe in"". The outcome  as these columns arguably reflect  is Empire of Chaos - where a plutocracy progressively projects its own internal disintegration upon the whole world.""<p>
""You will find some key overlapping nations/themes/expressions/acronyms in these columns; Iran  Iraq  Syria  Afghanistan  Pakistan  Central Asia  China  Russia  Ukraine  Pipelineistan  BRICS  EU  NATO  GCC  the Global South  GWOT (the global war on terror)  The New Great Game  Full Spectrum Dominance. You will also find a progressive drift towards not conventional war  but above all economic war - manifestations of Liquid War.""<p>

Incrementally  I have been arguing that Washington's number one objective now is to prevent a full economic integration of Eurasia that would leave the U.S. as a non-hegemon  or worse still  an outsider. Thus the three-pronged strategy of ""pivoting to Asia"" (containment of China); Ukraine (containment of Russia); and beefing up NATO (subjugation of Europe  and NATO as Global Robocop).""<p>

Recognising the impossibility of improving upon the (in)famous 5:5:3 ratio of the Washington Naval Treaty when the expected naval race would begin as the treaty expired  the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a strategy of qualitative superiority to overcome the American quantitative edge. The IJN succeeded  after many studies and false starts  in creating the world's most heavily armed (nine 18.1"" main guns in three triple turrets - the largest calibre ever mounted) and protected (410-mm thick VH belt armor  660-mm thick front shields of the gun houses - the thickest armour plates ever mounted) battleships. With a displacement in excess of 70 000 tons their size was unprecedented but despite this restrictions resulted in defects  which otherwise might have been avoided; other defects were the result of techniques below the highest standard.  Because the qualities of a battleship were generally measured by gun power  protection and mobility the authors have focused upon these items after giving a rough outline of the design and building processes. The result is probably the most detailed description based upon Japanese sources published outside Japan.  

Stimulated by Gustav Jensen's expanded dissertation Japans Seemacht and encouraged by Messrs. Erich Gröner and Prof. Jürgen Rohwer  Hans Lengerer began writing on the IJN in 1969. Over the years more than 50 articles have appeared in magazines like Marine Rundschau  Marine Forum  Warship and Interconair Aviation e Marina. After retirement from service in an executive organ  Lengerer continues to write books and articles using a considerable amount of time for his hobby. He is also the author of the privately published Contributions to the History of Imperial Japanese Warships  referred to in this book  and is presently working to revise and condense his 250 000-word manuscript Development of Warship Construction in Japan and to complete A History of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As ""hobby researcher"" at best  his writings depend heavily upon information supplied by other IJN fans; they come first therefore. 

Lars Ahlberg is on active duty with the Swedish Air Defence Regiment and is a military historian by avocation. He has written monographs about the IJN battleships of the Nagato class and the IJN aircraft carrier Taihô. His articles have appeared in Sveriges Flotta  Warship International and Okrety Wojenne and for several years he has been the editor of Contributions to the History of Imperial Japanese Warships. Ahlberg has also co-authored two books about Swedish regiments: Kungl Hallands regementes historia 1962-2000 and Kasernerna på Galgberget.",,"18-inch,dreadnought,ijn,japanese navy,musashi,Okinawa,Samar,space battleship yamato,Taffy 3,Task Force 34,yamato",Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,556,,N,,16-Dec-14,16-Dec-14,64.95,54.95,61.99,64.95,65.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Deliver,No,No,No,No,64.95,,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,64.95,30,,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The foreword is by a renowned professor of Geopolitics of the Hellenic Military Academy  Dr Constantinos Grivas. The Russians fought on the side of the breakaway Republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in a war  which is also known as ""The Five Day War"". There is an extensive analysis on the diplomatic prelude occurring prior to the beginning of the hostilities  debating the causes that led Georgia to attack the breakaways and Russia to defend them. The prelude covers deep historical topics since the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent rise of Gamsakhurdia  the nationalist Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze  whose toppling by the Rose Revolution brought Mikhail Saakashvili to power. Military operations are described and analyzed thoroughly starting from the skirmishes between Georgians and Ossetians and culminating with the war's most decisive battle  the battle of Tskhinvali. The essay sheds light on the new Russian military doctrine and the reforms  which took place in the Russian Army  following the Five Day War  in all sectors including the Army   VDV troops  the Air Force and the Navy. Finally  an extensive analysis is carried out both in the framework of geoeconomics and that of international relations and geopolitics  around Russia's future diplomatic ties with the EU and the US  separately  including the recent events in the US and European Economies  which have led to the manifestation of a European power centralized around Germany.  The battle of Tskhinvali may well have settled the fate of the Caucasus for the 21st century  and foreshadowed the campaigns in Crimea  Ukraine  and beyond.",,,Color 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,116,,N,,8-Aug-15,8-Aug-15,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Far from ""being made obsolete in a single day""  Lundgren upends the conventional wisdom by showing that the battle line was an essential tool for the exercise of seapower all the way to V-J Day.    Indeed  he argues  the Japanese Navy's undue reliance on aircraft carriers alone was a key factor in its loss of command of the sea.  
 
From the introduction: ""Human perception is human reality and I offer a different perspective on battleships by applying the principles of several naval and military thinkers  including Alfred Thayer Mahan and Julian Corbett that may change the perception that battleships became obsolete? By the end of the World War Two the aircraft carrier had replaced the battleship as the reigning queen of the seas. No new battleships designs were created leaving the last four Iowa class battleships to be the last of their kind to serve the United States. What role did battleships  aircraft carriers  cruisers  and submarines play in the United States victory and Japan's defeat during the Second World War? I will argue here that  contrary to conventional wisdom  battleships continued to play a decisive role throughout the war."" 
 
Through a meticulous examination of the operational details of every major battle in the War in the Pacific  Lundgren illuminates how the US prevailed with a ""combined arms"" approach that made use of all the particular capabilities of aircraft carriers  battleships  and submarines.  Only in this way could a navy follow the fundamental principles of sea power identified by Mahan and Corbett.  
 
This is a must read for anyone who thinks they know the history of the War in the Pacific.  A wonderful gift that will spark many debates among battleship and naval aviation enthusiasts alike.  

Robert Lundgren is also the author of The World Wonder'd: What Really Happened Off Samar (Nimble 2014).

The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world,9781608880584,1608880583,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"The Saker,","Escobar, Pepe",,Author,Foreword by,,,,,POL032000,POLITICAL SCIENCE / Essays,POL011000,POLITICAL SCIENCE / International Relations / General,POL047000,POLITICAL SCIENCE / Imperialism,Nimble Pluribus,,,,,,"<p>These are some of the most essential articles written by the Saker on his blog. Even though they cover topics ranging from history  to politics  to religion  to military affairs  to social issues  they are all linked by one common thread: the full-spectrum clash between the Western world and what the Saker calls the ""Russian civilizational realm"". Most Russians  especially when addressing a western audience  feel compelled to use a diplomatic and non-confrontational language. In contrast  Saker's style is informal  almost conversational  but also direct  even blunt. He is fully aware that his views might offend many of his readers  but he believes that there is also a bigger audience out there which will appreciate an honest and  above all  sincere criticism of what the Saker calls the ""AngloZionist Empire"". The careful reader  however  will notice that the Saker's criticisms are always aimed at a political system and its constituent institutions and supporting ideologies  but never at the people  nations or ethnicities.  In fact  the Saker forcefully argues for a multi-cultural  multi-ethnic and multi-religious Russia which would be fully integrated in a multi-polar world inspired by the fraternal diversity of the BRICS countries. Underlying the Saker's entire worldview is a categorical rejection of all ideologies and a profound belief that the root of all evil as well as the key to defeating it is always in the realm of spirituality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>""Reading the &ldquo;Saker&rdquo; is essential &ndash; it is at this media space where one can discern the real trenches and battle lines in today&rsquo;s super-charged information wars. I read the &ldquo;Saker&rdquo; not only for the facts (that are verified and applied in context)  but also for a moral and discipled attitude toward geopolitics. The &ldquo;Saker&rdquo; is not only a good read; it is also a way of looking at the world. Simply put: the &ldquo;Saker&rdquo; is information that is weaponized and hits all the right targets!""</p>

Howard Cosell  ABC Sports commentator:  ""[Radakovich] built the tradition of linebackers at Penn State who now seem to inhabit the National Football League...He formed the great defensive line called the ""Steel Curtain"" of Greene  Greenwood  Holnes and White...and built the offensive line that blew the Oakland Raiders out of the ballpark yesterday.""  (1976 ABC radio broadcast)<p>

Art Rooney Jr.  Vice President  Pittsburgh Steelers: ""Terrific book! Very insightful about professional and college football-also very humorous. I especially liked the story about doing the mirror dodge drill against The Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.""   

Notre Dame offensive line coach Harry Hiestan:  ""Bad Rad's book is the story of one of the great football coaches of all time  and his incredible coaching life. Rad has a way of making the most  important part of football  the fundementals  clear and understandable. A man with strong principles details incredible stories in this book. Some situations he made hard on himself because of his pursuit of what was right.There is only one Bad Rad and the stories in this book will help you understand what that means. Rad has helped many football players be the best  they can be  at every level of football; and also many coaches. I am one of the fortunate ones he has taken time to make better.""<p>

Kirk Ferentz  head football coach  University of Iowa:  ""terrific book!""  <p>

DAN RADAKOVICH was the originator of the Pittsburgh Steelers' ""steel curtain"" defensive line; coached the super bowl IX  X  and XIV offensive lines;and was the father of Penn State's ""Linebacker U.""<p>

LOU PRATO is a veteran print and broadcast journalist who has covered Penn State football periodically since his undergraduate days at Penn State when Dan Radakovich was a player and then an assistant coach. He also is a lifelong Pittsburgh Steelers fan  dating from the late 1940s  and in the 1960s he wrote many stories about the Steelers  including the hiring of Coach Chuck Noll. Prato is the author of four books on Penn State football: The Penn State Football Encyclopedia  What It Means to be A Nittany Lion; Penn State Football Vault; and Game Changers: The Greatest Plays in Penn State Football History. Prato helped organize and start the Penn State All-Sports Museum and in 2001 he became the Museum's first  director  retiring from that position at the end of 2005. He is now contributing writer for two publications dedicated to Penn State football fans  Blue White Illustrated and Fight On State magazine. Lou and his wife Carole  who assisted Lou and Dan in writing this book  have been going to Penn State football games together since 1955  and Prato says Carole was a Penn State fan long before him.<p>",,,B&W 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Case Laminate on White w/Gloss Lam,396,,N,,7-Feb-16,7-Feb-16,32.99,24.99,40.99,29.99,43.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,32.99,,29.95,32.99,32.99,32.99,29.95,29.95,32.99,32.99,32.99,32.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It won't be asking you questions like ""what school did Harry Potter go to?"" (If you are a Harry Potter fan  then of course you know the answer!) Rather it asks questions which will develop your literary appreciation of the Harry Potter books and your general knowledge of the Harry Potter phenomenon. Some of these questions are easy  quite a few are fiendishly difficult  and several of them really don't have simple answers  but thinking about possible answers is what it is all about. Work through this quiz book (with an eye on the answers) and come out the other end with a much better understanding of the phenomenon that is Harry Potter. After each question  space is provided in which you may jot down your preliminary answer. <p>In this quiz book there is a focus on the language used by J. K. Rowling. From alchemy to whomping via such gems as hallows and knickerbockers the books use a range of words which are not part of the everyday word stock of most speakers of English  and certainly not of most children. True fans of the Harry Potter series will want to know them! There is a mass of information around the world of Harry Potter  some of it trivia (but fun!)  some key to our appreciation of the books. Also fans have realized that the books have some serious points to make.

The core message of We Tried to Warn You is that every day  micro-failures of communication and their cover-ups can accumulate  and enable a network of decisions that lead to systemic-level failures of organizations. I report on first hand experiences as an organizational participant  and more recently as a design/management consultant  informed by the substantive research published over the years by key authors I have learned from  and cite in the book.
<P>
We Tried to Warn You presents a case study in compact form  with identifying details obscured to protect the great and the guilty alike. I focus emphasis on the knowledge-based practices that enable organizations to sense and make decisions from critical feedback from customers in the field  especially the multidisciplinary field now known as ""user experience"" (or UX). UX has become a primary conduit for understanding ""real users"" and their needs in current organizations worldwide. UX is often involved throughout all phases of a project  from user research  to product concept design  to final design and user testing.
<P> 
As a still-emerging knowledge discipline  UX practices were developed in the case organization as a response to a systemic failure  with outstanding positive results. The book also shares lessons learned from a process called socialization  which distributes leadership and skill development among organizational players in the formation of key strategic practices such as UX.",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,72,,N,,11-Aug-08,21-Aug-08,22.99,16.99,28.99,20.99,29.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,22.99,,20.81,22.99,22.99,22.99,20.81,20.81,22.99,22.99,22.99,22.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

In 2008 it had more than 5 000. The number of military ground robots jumped from 160 in 2004 to around 4 000 in 2006. Only underwater robots lagged: so far just a few dozen systems have entered service. Under the water is  after all  the toughest environment for robots. But even undersea bots will see a boost in coming years. The Pentagon has plans to spend at least $4 billion a year for the foreseeable future designing and building robots.<p>
The spread of robots in our armies  navies and air forces has greatly advanced the science  engineering and techniques for mixing thinking people and thinking machines. And it has forced us to try answering a basic moral question. Just how much responsibility should we surrender to machines? If and when robots fulfill their promise to make war cheaper and easier for our side  will we discover that we wage war too lightly? Are we already guilty of that sin?<p>
This book examines just a handful of the many types of war bots  and just a few of the ways they're being used in the expanding American-led ""war on terror.""

I argued then that in a context of re-medievalization - the world fragmented into ""stans"" - we are now living an intestinal war  an undeclared global civil war. Borrowing from Zygmunt Bauman's concept of liquid modernity  I called it Liquid War - and not only because of the global scramble for ""black gold"" oil and ""blue gold"" gas. <p>
Globalistan was essentially a long reportage crisscrossing the world. This text reflects the fact that I spent most of 2008 in the U.S. following the presidential campaign. As far as New Rome is concerned I'm usually outside looking in - the point of view of my dying profession  the foreign correspondent. In this text I'm most of the time inside looking out. Globalistan can be read as an on the ground - and underground - report on the Bush administration wasteland. This text could be something of a last chapter - out of the belly of the beast.<p>     
2009 is the Mother of all celebratory years. The 20 years of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The 30 years of the Iranian Islamic revolution. The 50 years of the Cuban revolution. The 60 years of NATO. The 70 years of World War II. The 80 years of the Great Depression. The 90 years of the Versailles Treaty. It's as if the world was turning on its gyre as in a psychedelic kaleidoscope reviving modern history in high-speed. And which figure comes out of the kaleidoscope  grinning his cool  calm and collected best to deal with a 1929-style crisis  the new Cold War or perhaps to conduct Versailles-style diplomacy?

""No one is more qualified to talk about the history of Nepal than Colonel John Philip Cross.... In his book  The Call of Nepal  Cross portrays his profoundly personal journal  as he terms it  rooted not only in the physical - but deeply in the mental  emotional and spiritual.<p>
During his lifetime Cross has long practiced linguistic and cultural immersion in Nepal both personally  and in the context of his time with the Gurkhas in what today's military analysts must clearly see as an integral component of military success. But with today's military pace  the time to achieve the depth of Cross's insight is not always affordable.<p>
 A pioneer in many respects  Cross saw fluency and correct use of language not only as a tactical weapon but also as a vital  literally  element of command. It is this depth of knowledge  which also comes from understanding  living  and being part of Nepalese history that makes him and his writing such an invaluable resource.""<p>",,,B&W 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,500,,N,,30-Sep-09,1-Jul-09,32.99,24.99,40.99,29.99,43.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,32.99,,29.95,32.99,32.99,32.99,29.95,29.95,32.99,32.99,32.99,32.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Sasha was born not in the United States but in China  and she arrived there during a time of great economic and political distress. In the three years after her birth in 1956  a massive  politically in-duced famine left upwards of 30 million Chinese people dead. Sev-eral years later  communist party Chairman Mao Zedong launched the disastrous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution  a massive  decade-long political campaign that turned millions of China's most talented and potentially productive citizens into enemies of the state.<p>
Sasha says that being a citizen of the United States has allowed her to become more Chinese. The more American she becomes the prouder she is of her Chinese heritage  the more she is able to re-turn to its traditional Confucian values.

Maitland,9781934840948,1934840947,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"MacFarlane, Alan, Professor",,,Author,,,,,,LAW052000,LAW / Jurisprudence,HIS015000,HISTORY / Europe / Great Britain / General,HIS037060,HISTORY / Modern / 19th Century,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Alan Macfarlane writes of F. W. Maitland:
<p>
When we consider that some five thousand pages of detailed findings  written
about a hundred years ago  have been modified in only a few minor emphases
and one or two facts  and that the bulk of Maitland's edifice still stands  we can
begin to understand why he has an almost god-like status among historians who
know the problems he faced and the elegance of his solutions.<p>

The great legal historian Vinogradoff disagreed with Maitland on some specific
points  but shortly after Maitland's death wrote of him as 'the greatest legal
historian of the law of England' and as a man to whom lawyers  historians and
sociologists were equally indebted: 'lawyers because of his subject  historians
because of his methods  sociologists because of his results.'<p>

J.H.Hexter referred to Maitland as 'the greatest of English historians' in his
book on modern historians. R.G.Collingwood referred to the 'best historians 
like Mommsen and Maitland'. Denys Hay in his overview of western
historiography describes him as a 'giant' who  with Marc Bloch  is one of the 'two
greatest historians of recent times'. Bloch himself referred to 'the great English
jurist Maitland.' The medievalist Helen Cam ends her preface to his Selected
Essays by concluding fifty years after his death. 'Let us say with Powicke 
""Maitland is one of the immortals"" and leave it at that.' G.O.Sayles wrote that
'In the range of his interests  the fineness of his intellect  and the considerable
bulk of what he wrote in barely twenty-five years  Maitland has no match among
English historians.' <p>

Driven on by the sense of an impending early death Maitland tried to solve
within a period of some twenty years the same riddle as earlier thinkers. How
had the strange modern world  with its glimpses of liberty  equality and wealth 
been made? Why had it found its expression in a certain part of the world and in
its earliest and definitive form in England? What precisely were the constituents of this peculiar civilization? His solutions  much more deeply based on
documents  were in substance the same as those put forward by Montesquieu 
Adam Smith and Tocqueville. The essence of modernity lay in the separation of
spheres  the tensions between religion  politics  kinship and economy. Out of
these contradictions emerged certain liberties and a dynamic energy.<p>

 A whole set of factors  from the general (the nature of islandhood  the
accident of the Norman Conquest  the absence of Cathar heresies and the
inquisition)  to the individual (the personality of Henry II or Edward I) played
their part. What happened on one small island both reflected what happened on
its neighbouring continent  but also transformed it. Like some new species of
finch on the Galapagos  there developed a new kind of civilization. This would
then be magnified and taken to its extreme through other accidents  the
development of America  the expansion of the British Empire and the first
industrial revolution and so to the modern world. With Maitland we have a
developed theory which puts forward a believable answer to one part of the
question of how the modern world has been made.<p>",,,Premium Color 7 x 10 in or 254 x 178 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,106,,N,,1-Sep-09,25-Aug-09,24.99,18.99,30.99,22.99,32.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,24.99,,22.84,24.99,24.99,24.99,22.84,22.84,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

A cabal of generals took the nation's reins and bungled their way toward an accommodation with the Allies. When General Eisenhower announced an armistice with Italy on the evening of 8 September he believed he had struck a deal that included Italian military cooperation against the Germans. In fact  the generals had promised more than they could deliver and Germany's terrible  swift reprisal shattered Italy's confused air force and army. The armistice likewise caught the navy by surprise  with its battleships raising steam to attack the Allied fleet landing at Salerno. Nonetheless  the Regia Marina obeyed its government's orders and honored the pact the generals had negotiated. Rather than evaporating like Italy's other services  however  it proceeded to fight a three-week campaign against Germany  without Allied support  and in the process retained complete control of its ships  regardless of the ports necessity forced them to seek refuge in.<p>
 
This is the story of the Regia Marina and the Italian armistice of September 1943. It is a deeply-researched and highly readable exploration of this confusing and fascinating corner of history. It refutes the conventional notion that Italy's fleet abjectly surrendered to Allied power. It shows how the navy paved Italy's path from enemy to co-belligerent with the blood and unconquered spirit of its men. Despite German and Allied intentions to secure Italy's fleet for their own uses  it remained Italian to the end: a dark navy - not victorious  but undefeated.<p>

<h2>About DARK NAVY</h2>

The huge tragedy suffered by the Italian navy and nation has been reduced  until today  to a brief mention in the very few books available abroad about the Regia Marina's war between 1940 and 1945. It is thus quite important that a new essay directed toward English speaking readers is dedicated  at last  to these events  allowing them to sortie beyond the confines of Italian naval historiography--which has long debated these themes--and beyond the scanty circulation abroad of the Italian language.--Erminio Bagnasco  editor of STORIA Militare<p>

DARK NAVY is a masterful account of the Regia Marina's role in the Armistice of September 1943. The authors are to be commended for overturning the propagandist mythology which has often marred English-language histories of this difficult period in Italian history. A riveting story.--John Jordan  editor of WARSHIP<p>

DARK NAVY gives an excellent overview of the naval  air  and land impact on the Italian military at the time of the 8 September 1943 Armistice. It clearly shows the hesitancy of various leaders  on both sides  as they grappled with ""what to do?"" in this radically changed wartime environment and gives solid detail on the actions that resulted.--Jack Greene  author (with Alessandro Massigiani) of NAVAL WAR IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 1940-1943.<p>",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,108,,N,,19-Nov-09,10-Nov-09,29.99,22.99,37.99,26.99,39.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,29.99,,27.63,29.99,29.99,29.99,27.63,27.63,29.99,29.99,29.99,29.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

From the Executive Summary:<p>

On October 7  2001  U.S. aircraft began bombing the training
bases and strongholds of Al Qaeda and the ruling Taliban across
Afghanistan. The leaders who sent murderers to attack the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon less than a month earlier and the
rogue government that provided them sanctuary were running for
their lives. President George W. Bush's expression of America's desire
to get Osama bin Laden ''dead or alive'' seemed about to come
true.<p>
Two months later  American civilian and military leaders celebrated
what they viewed as a lasting victory with the selection of
Hamid Karzai as the country's new hand-picked leader. The war
had been conceived as a swift campaign with a single objective: defeat
the Taliban and destroy Al Qaeda by capturing or killing bin
Laden and other key leaders. A unique combination of airpower 
Central Intelligence Agency and special operations forces teams
and indigenous allies had swept the Taliban from power and ousted
Al Qaeda from its safe haven while keeping American deaths to a
minimum. But even in the initial glow  there were concerns: The
mission had failed to capture or kill bin Laden.<p>

It shows how globalization is not proceeding according to the myth of &quot;everyone profits&quot;: instead  it is fragmenting the world into even more explosive inequality  into &quot;stans&quot; - some stans configured as fortresses  some stans at war with others. Energy wars  and the multiple intersections of globalization and war  only increase the polarization. Globalistan argues that the world is being dissolved into Liquid War - a natural consequence of &quot;liquid modernity &quot; a concept formulated by Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman. The book is 80% based on reportage - from China to Central Asia and Russia; before  during and after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; in Iran and in the Middle East; in Western Europe  Western Africa and South America.

Among them are those who courageously face repeated hospitalizations  surgeries  feeding tubes  dialysis  EEGs  respiration and heart monitors  and a life-time of therapy. Lexie has a medical condition that requires her to spend a lot of time in therapy  at hospitals  and in doctors&#39; offices. She knows first-hand just how difficult  painful  and scary  these experiences can be. &quot;Be brave and know that you are not alone&quot; is Lexie&#39;s message  as she encourages young children who face these challenges in Brave Just Like Me.</p><p>Brave Just Like Me was inspired by a three year old girl named Lexie  who was born with a life threatening medical condition. One day  shortly after Lexie returned home from her second kidney transplant surgery  her mother held her in her arms while she slept. It was a day like many others  but as her mother gazed in deepest admiration on her brave little girl  the words to this book were born - not in a slow or uncertain trickle but in strong  overpowering waves. So compelling was this experience  that Lexie&#39;s mother laid her sleeping child in bed to capture these words in writing. Inspired by love and a deep desire to acknowledge  comfort  and encourage children who face the same hardships her daughter experiences  Kimberly wrote her first children&#39;s book.</p><p>It was only a matter of days before this first time author found an illustrator  who not only offered but insisted on painting the illustrations for the book and donating the artwork. Stacy spent years painting for the book  as her schedule allowed  and through many personal challenges. Through Stacy  Kimberly found Leslie  a graphic design artist who helped finish the illustrations and set words to art  again donating her work to the cause  despite her own personal hardships. The book moved from Stacy  to Leslie  to Aaron  who volunteered to scan the artwork into print ready files. The book then found its way to a publisher  who not only believed enough in the book to publish it  but valued an affordable price point over profit to ensure the book reached those who needed it most. So  really  Brave Just Like Me has two stories to tell - one about a brave little girl and one about the kindness and goodness of people.</p><p>Each person who has touched this book wants only one thing from this endeavor - to comfort and encourage young children who are working courageously to overcome the pain and disabilities that often accompany serious and life threatening medical conditions. &quot;It is our sincerest hope that Brave Just Like Me finds its way into the hands of these precious children. We would encourage anyone who purchases this book for a loved one to also consider donating a copy to a local children&#39;s hospital  pediatrician  therapist  or Ronald McDonald House.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>This special keepsake edition of Brave Just Like Me includes an opening page where young readers can record their names. The author has included a list of questions at the end of the story that will help parents and educators explore anxieties and fears surrounding the medical experiences children endure  to help them identify strategies for coping  and to carve out opportunities for celebrating their courage and strength. This book contains several keepsake pages where the child can collect pictures  signatures  and well wishes from doctors  nurses  family  and friends who have helped them through their medical journey. It is the author and the publisher&rsquo;s sincerest hope that these keepsake pages will inspire children with serious medical conditions to someday share their story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>,,"childhood illness,hospitalization",Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on White w/Gloss Lam,38,,N,,21-Jul-20,21-Jul-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,21.99,,20.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,20.95,20.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

A cabal of generals took the nation&#39;s reins and bungled their way toward an accommodation with the Allies. When General Eisenhower announced an armistice with Italy on the evening of 8 September he believed he had struck a deal that included Italian military cooperation against the Germans. In fact  the generals had promised more than they could deliver and Germany&#39;s terrible  swift reprisal shattered Italy&#39;s confused air force and army. The armistice likewise caught the navy by surprise  with its battleships raising steam to attack the Allied fleet landing at Salerno. Nonetheless  the Regia Marina obeyed its government&#39;s orders and honored the pact the generals had negotiated. Rather than evaporating like Italy&#39;s other services  however  it proceeded to fight a three-week campaign against Germany  without Allied support  and in the process retained complete control of its ships  regardless of the ports necessity forced them to seek refuge in.</p><p>This is the story of the Regia Marina and the Italian armistice of September 1943. It is a deeply-researched and highly readable exploration of this confusing and fascinating corner of history. It refutes the conventional notion that Italy&#39;s fleet abjectly surrendered to Allied power. It shows how the navy paved Italy&#39;s path from enemy to co-belligerent with the blood and unconquered spirit of its men. Despite German and Allied intentions to secure Italy&#39;s fleet for their own uses  it remained Italian to the end: a dark navy - not victorious  but undefeated.</p><p>Vincent P. O&#39;Hara and Enrico Cernuschi have collaborated for publications including <em>Warship  World War II Magazine  World War II Quarterly  </em> and the new <em>Seaforth Naval Review</em>. Mr. O&#39;Hara has written several books including <em>Struggle for the Middle Sea: the Great Navies at War in the Mediterranean 1939-1945</em> (Annapolis  2009). Mr. Cernuschi is a regular contributor to Rivista Marittima and Storia Militare.

It is thus quite important that a new essay directed toward English speaking readers is dedicated  at last  to these events  allowing them to sortie beyond the confines of Italian naval historiography--which has long debated these themes--and beyond the scanty circulation abroad of the Italian language.--Erminio Bagnasco  editor of STORIA Militare</p><p>DARK NAVY is a masterful account of the Regia Marina&#39;s role in the Armistice of September 1943. The authors are to be commended for overturning the propagandist mythology which has often marred English-language histories of this difficult period in Italian history. A riveting story.--John Jordan  editor of WARSHIP</p><p>DARK NAVY gives an excellent overview of the naval  air  and land impact on the Italian military at the time of the 8 September 1943 Armistice. It clearly shows the hesitancy of various leaders  on both sides  as they grappled with &quot;what to do?&quot; in this radically changed wartime environment and gives solid detail on the actions that resulted.--Jack Greene  author (with Alessandro Massigiani) of NAVAL WAR IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 1940-1943.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>,,,Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Gloss Lam,108,,N,,27-Jul-20,27-Jul-20,26.99,20.99,33.99,24.99,36.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,26.99,,24.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,24.99,24.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

This publication answers why spacepower is vital for our&nbsp;Nation  how military spacepower is employed  who military space&nbsp;forces are  and what military space forces value. In short  this capstone&nbsp;document is the foundation of our professional body of knowledge as&nbsp;we forge an independent military Service committed to space operations.&nbsp;Like all doctrine  the SCP remains subject to the policies and&nbsp;strategies that govern its employment. Military spacepower has deterrent&nbsp;and coercive capacities - it provides independent options for&nbsp;National and Joint leadership but achieves its greatest potential when&nbsp;integrated with other forms of military power. As we grow spacepower&nbsp;theory and doctrine  we must do so in a way that fosters greater&nbsp;integration with the Air Force  Army  Navy  Marine Corps  and Coast&nbsp;Guard. It is only by achieving true integration and interdependence&nbsp;that we can hope to unlock spacepower's full potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Agility  innovation  and boldness have always been the touchstone&nbsp;traits of military space forces. Today  we must harness these traits to&nbsp;pioneer a new Service and a new professional body of knowledge.&nbsp;This capstone doctrine is a point-of-departure toward that goal  not a&nbsp;final adjudication. Given the nascent state of spacepower theory  this&nbsp;publication will inevitably evolve over time as it is applied  evaluated &nbsp;and refined.

For example  the Committee examined Paul Manafort's connections to Russian influence actors and the FBI' s treatment of reporting produced by Christopher Steele. While the Committee does not describe the final result as a complete picture  this volume provides the most comprehensive description to date of Russia's activities and the threat they posed. This volume presents this information in topical sections in order to address coherently and in detail the wide variety of Russian actions.

Commandant's Planning Guidance: 38th Commandant of the Marine Corps,9781608881475,1608881474,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Berger, General David H.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,HIS027060,HISTORY / Military / Strategy,,,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,,,"<p>The Commandant's Planning Guidance (CPG) provides the 38th Commandant's strategic direction for the Marine Corps and mirrors the function of the Secretary of Defense's Defense Planning Guidance (DPG). It serves as the authoritative document for Service-level planning and provides a common direction to the Marine Corps Total Force. It also serves as a road map describing where the Marine Corps is going and why; what the Marine Corps force development priorities are and are not; and  in some instances  how and when prescribed actions will be implemented. This CPG serves as my Commandant's Intent for the next four years.</p><p><br></p><p>As Commandant Neller observed  ""The Marine Corps is not organized  trained  equipped  or postured to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving future operating environment."" I concur with his diagnosis. Significant change is required to ensure we are aligned with the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) and DPG  and further  prepared to meet the demands of the Naval Fleet in executing current and emerging operational naval concepts. Effecting that change will be my top priority as your 38th Commandant.</p><p><br></p><p>This CPG outlines my five priority focus areas: force design  warfighting  education and training  core values  and command and leadership. I will use these focal areas as logical lines of effort to frame my thinking  planning  and decision-making at Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC)  as well as to communicate to our civilian leadership. This document explains how we will translate those focus areas into action with measurable outcomes. The institutional changes that follow this CPG will be based on a long-term view and singular focus on where we want the Marine Corps to be in the next 5-15 years  well beyond the tenure of any one Commandant  Presidential administration  or Congress. We cannot afford to retain outdated policies  doctrine  organizations  or force development strategies.</p><p><br></p><p>The coming decade will be characterized by conflict  crisis  and rapid change - just as every decade preceding it. And despite our best efforts  history demonstrates that we will fail to accurately predict every conflict; will be surprised by an unforeseen crisis; and may be late to fully grasp the implications of rapid change around us. The Arab Spring  West African Ebola Outbreak  Scarborough Shoal standoff  Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine  and weaponization of social media are but a few recent examples illustrating the point. While we must accept an environment characterized by uncertainty  we cannot ignore strong signals of change nor be complacent when it comes to designing and preparing the force for the future.</p><p><br></p><p>What is abundantly clear is that the future operating environment will place heavy demands on our Nation's Naval Services. Context and direction is clearly articulated in the NDS and DPG as well as testimony from our uniformed and civilian leadership. No further guidance is required; we are moving forward. The Marine Corps will be trained and equipped as a naval expeditionary force-in-readiness and prepared to operate inside actively contested maritime spaces in support of fleet operations. In crisis prevention and crisis response  the Fleet Marine Force - acting as an extension of the Fleet - will be first on the scene  first to help  first to contain a brewing crisis  and first to fight if required to do so. The Marine Corps will be the ""force of choice"" for the President  Secretary  and Combatant Commander - ""a certain force for an uncertain world"" as noted by Commandant Krulak. No matter what the crisis  our civilian leaders should always have one shared thought - Send in the Marines.</p>",,"china,cruise missiles,marine corps,naval history,navy,strategy,warfare",Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Matte Lam,28,Y,,,8-Oct-20,8-Oct-20,15.99,11.99,20.99,14.99,21.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,15.99,,14.99,15.99,15.99,15.99,14.99,14.99,15.99,15.99,15.99,15.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Viewers who enjoy movies like Dr. Strangelove  Fail Safe  and Strategic Air Command will find this a fascinating look into the mindset of the era's aviators.&nbsp; Survival under adverse conditions ranging up to hot war was a very real concern. Dozens of US aircraft were shot down during the Cold War.</p><p><br></p><p>From the Foreword by General Nathan Twining:</p><p><br></p><p>This Manual is designed for use of students in the Air Force survival training courses. It amplifies AFM 64-5  Survival  by including training information not covered in the kit edition because of weight and size of limitations. AFM 64-3 can also be used as a source book of survival information. It includes much detailed information which would have been beyond the intended scope of the smaller publication; it tells the reader not only what he must do but also why he must do it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Because of the global responsibilities of the United States Air Force  all Air Force personnel face the possibility of survival in a remote or desolate area of the world. It is the purpose of this Manual to prepare all personnel participating in flights on military aircraft for an intelligent approach to any possible survival situation. The reader is shown that nature and the elements are· neither friendly nor hostile and that the training and attitude he carries with him will determine his success in survival.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Manual opens with a discussion of the problems and techniques of general land survival: psy­chological problems  immediate action  camping and woodcraft  travel  clothing  signaling  food  and other related subjects. Then the ensuing chapters cover the special requirements for survival in the follow­ing areas: Arctic  desert  Tropics  sea  and sea ice.&nbsp;</p>,,"air force,B-36,B-47,B-52,bombers,Cold War,Dr. Strangelove,evasion,Fail Safe,fighter,public domain,resistance,SAC,SERE,Strategic Air Command,survival,united states air force,USAF",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,378,Y,,,9-Oct-20,9-Oct-20,34.95,24.97,39.99,28.99,44.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,34.95,,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,40,,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It provides a basic summary of facts about the manuscript and its provenance and adds a survey of proposed solutions  most of which it dispenses with quite quickly. I found it interesting to discover that Tiltman was first introduced to the Voynich ms. by William Friedman  founder of the NSA  in 1947 (!)  I was also intrigued that Tiltman's scholarly research into the history of medieval herbalism included consultations with leading English academics  no doubt during visits on ""Five Eyes"" business.</p><p><br></p><p>The second essay  originally classifed Top Secret Umbra  is ""An Application of PTAH to the Voynich Manuscript"" by Mary D'Imperio - the title itself was unclassified.   A few pages in  I came to a full stop when I encountered this:</p><p><br></p><p> ""PTAH (named for the Egyptian god of wisdom)  is a general statistical method developed at IDA (Institute for Defense Analyses)  Princeton University.  PTAH got its name when a programmer. Mr.Gerry Mitchell  was listening to the opera ""Aida"" while working on his program. He was struck by the passage ""immenso Ptah noi invociam "" and named his program after the Egyptian god. The name was ultimately extended from this program  implementing a particular application of the method  to the method and its mathematical theory as well...""</p><p> </p><p> The technical meaning of PTAH remains classified  although Google helped me find a journal article that suggests PTAH must be some sort of Hidden Markov Model. (Math. Comput. Appl. 2019  24  14; doi:10.3390/mca24010014)</p><p><br></p><p> D'Imperio used PTAH to analyze the Voynich manuscript and similar works and concluded that ""I find the above comparisions quite convincing support for a view that the Voynich text  regarded as a string of single letters  does not 'act like' natural language. Instead  it exhibits a clear positional regularity or characters within words. I believe that these findings strengthen the theory of Friedman and Tiltman that an artificial language may underlie the Yoynich text.""</p><p><br></p><p> Government interest dating back to 1947 ... pharmacology unknown to modern man ... artificial languages ... the movie ""ARRIVAL"" based on Ted Chiang's ""Story of Your Life"" ...  hmmm ...</p><p><br></p><p>The third essay  also by D'Imperio  is ""An Application of Cluster Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling to the Question of 'Hands' and 'Languages' in the Voynich Manuscript."" She uses cluster analytic techniques to examine findings by Captain Prescott Currier  who suggested that the manuscript's pages can be clustered into groups of multiple authors and styles.  D'Imperio's discussion includes warnings that are still sound today: "" The interpretation of cluster analysis results is unavoidably circular; we propose a certain structure in the group of objects under study  we perform the computation  and we are happy if we see what we expected  or at least something that makes sense in terms of our original hypothesis  however revised.""</p><p><br></p><p>The fourth and final essay  by James Child  takes an important step forward by proposing that ""the Voynich Manuscript does not contain an artificial language nor the enciphered text of an underlying text in an unknown language. but is a text in a hitherto unknown medieval North Germanic dialect.""</p><p><br></p><p>People who enjoy works like THE DA VINCI CODE  PUZZLE PALACE  and Snowden will find this fascinating.</p><p><br></p>",,"antiquities,cryptography,da vinci code,dan brown,manuscripts,medieval,national security agency,nsa,snowden,voynich",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,96,Y,,,27-Oct-20,27-Oct-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

That gap is partly filled by this never previously published series of declassified official histories written by Sandia National Laboratories in the late 1960s.</p><p><br></p><p>This volume is a history of the gun-type artillery-fired atomic projectiles that entered service beginning in 1952 with the Mk 9 and followed by Mks 19  23  32  and 33. The work contains a timeline; a narrative history; a glossary of terms; and 58 footnotes.  </p><p><br></p><p>Development began in late 1949 (shortly after the first Soviet detonation of an atomic weapon) at the request of the Army.  Sandia defines the weapon's mission as ""a defensive or offensive weapon against infantry masses concentrated in front of the sector through which a breakthrough was planned. It was hoped that a nuclear artillery shell  fuzed for air burst  could destroy the ability of these troops to stage an attack  or defend the sector.""  It's noteworthy that the weapon was not expected to be used against the Soviet Union's primary land striking force  its tens of thousands of tanks in armored formations.  </p><p><br></p><p>The initial design was for a 890-lb shell that could be fired from a 280-mm gun at muzzle velocity of 1700 feet per second.  This was heavier and slower than a conventional shell and meant that special propellant charges  firing tables  and spotting shells were required in operation.  Prototype shells were being fired by mid-1951  and the the Mk 9 Mod 0-ZZ Shell was successfully tested in Operation Upshot-Knothole at the Nevada Test Site in Shot Grable on May 23  1953.  Yield was the expected 15 kilotons.  </p><p><br></p><p>The Mk 9 was replaced  by the Mk 19  which was the same weight as a conventional shell and thus could be operated under normal firing procedures.</p><p><br></p><p>The Mk 23 shell was developed to be fired from the 16-inch (405-mm) rifles on board US Navy battleships with an amphibious warfare rather than antiship mission in mind.  Initial deliveries were made to the Fleet in the same period as the Navy retired the last 16-inch rifle from active use.  </p><p><br></p><p>The TX-32 shell was intended for use in the 240-mm howitzer  but was cancelled in favor of an 8-inch (203-mm) implosion design proposed by the University of California Radiation Laboratory.  The Mk 33 shell was available by July 1955 for the 8-inch M-2 howitzer.</p><p><br></p><p>Fortunate indeed that the history of these particular weapons is not written in fire on the pages of history. In another world  this might be the story of the Mk 9 that was fired from ""Atomic Annie"" against the 5th Guards Banner Army at the Rhine  or the Katie that was fired from the battleship New Jersey to support the amphibious assault on Shanghai.</p>",,"artillery,atomic weapons,battleships,cold war,nuclear weapons,warfare",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,40,Y,,,27-Oct-20,27-Oct-20,17.99,13.99,21.99,15.99,22.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,15.95,17.99,17.99,17.99,15.95,15.95,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

That gap is partly filled by this never previously published series of declassified official histories written by Sandia National Laboratories in the late 1960s.  This 64-page reproduction of a declassified report includes a timetable of weapon events; a history of gun-type bombs and warheads; a glossary of terms; and references with 93 endnotes.</p><p><br></p><p>This largely unredacted report tells the story of the gun-type Mk 8 and Mk 11 nuclear warheads that were developed beginning in 1946 in response to primarily Naval requirements for nuclear warheads that could penetrate water  earth  or thin steel before detonating. Attention at Los Alamos at the time was focused on implosion-type warheads because gun-type warheads made inefficient use of fissionable materials  so the Bureau of Ordnance was asked to take the lead in initial studies before work moved to Sandia. The military asked the bomb designers to focus on gun-type warheads for several major missions: delivery via subsonic and supersonic aircraft; via cruise missile; and via guided missile. They were asked to ensure that the warhead would detonate successfully after penetrating water  earth  rock  and thin steel. An extensive testing program gave confidence that this could be achieved with gun-type warheads. There was some resistance to the the requirement for penetrating solid rock--a mission that in the modern era has become of paramount importance.</p><p><br></p><p>If the Mk 8 and its successor the Mk 11 had ever been used in anger  it would most likely have been in the context of a global nuclear war in the 1950s  perhaps beginning during the Korean War  delivered against targets on the periphery of the Soviet Union or against the People's Republic of China.  They would have been delivered via AD-4 Skyraiders flying from carriers like USS Princeton--think James Michener's <span style=""color: rgba(163  21  21  1)"">BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI--</span>or  later  a range of other Navy and Air Force aircraft.

That gap is partly filled by this never previously published series of declassified official histories written by Sandia National Laboratories in the late 1960s.  This reproduction of a declassified report  originally classified SECRET: RESTRICTED DATA  tells the story of the Mk 25 nuclear warheads  code-named DING DONG  that were developed beginning in 1951 for use in air defense.  The largely unredacted report includes a timetable of weapon events; a history of the Mk 25; a glossary of terms; and references with 57 endnotes. It tells a fascinating story.</p><p><br></p><p>The military requirements were driven by the potential of saturation attacks by mass formations of Soviet bombers and guided missiles that would in turn require defense of most of the perimeter of North America. ""It was predicted that that air defense weapons would have to be produced in large numbers  possibly tens of thousands  in order to provide an effective defense of any sizable portion of the country. They would thus have to be economical  both in nuclear and nonnuclear costs. These weapons would have to be operationally ready at all times to respond to a surprise attack  and they would have to be able to withstand exposure to climatic extremes ranging from the arctic to the tropics. The weapons should require only minor maintenance  since it would not be possible to provide a sufficiently large group of thoroughly trained technicians."" </p><p><br></p><p>The result of this analysis was the development beginning in 1954 of the Mk 25 air defense warhead.  Beginning in 1957 the Mk 25 was deployed on the GENIE unguided air-to-air missile launched by F-89 and F-102 interceptors. The optimum yield was calculated by still-classified methods that involved tradeoffs between the probability of kill  the weight of the missile and aircraft  efficiency in the use of nuclear materials  and the time needed for the launch aircraft to escape.  The Mk 25 and its successors were deployed on US and Canadian NORAD interceptors until the early 1980s.</p><p><br></p><p>To demonstrate that air defense nuclear weapons could be used without harm to the civilian population  the Air Force conducted a special demonstration during the John shot of the Operation Plumbob test series in 1957.  Five Air Force officers volunteered to stand  hatless  directly underneath ground zero of the 1.5 kt airburst. Video of them afterwards shows them shaking hands and lighting cigars.  Fun!  One can only imagine how much fun the civilian population of North America would have had watching Mk 25s light up the skies over cities such as Seattle  Winnipeg  Minneapolis  Detroit  Buffalo  and Boston.</p><p><br></p><p>Readers who enjoy content like DR.

This is a document with an optimistic view of its role in the world. It is not clear that policy leaders in any Administration are actually interested in outsourcing their decision-making to a tool developed by a previous admninistration.  To the contrary  policy-makers typically place a great deal of emphasis on getting their own people in place to ask the right questions.  </p><p><br></p><p>The main body of the Playbook is comprised of two major sections  one for international events that have not yet reached the US and one for events with a US locus.

This thesis investigates the United States' history of partnering with three of its closest allies-France  Australia  and Japan-since the dawn of the space age to see where the best opportunities for enhanced military space cooperation exist today. It finds that changes in the military space organizations  capabilities  and policies of these three allies since 2008 have significantly increased the ability of their militaries to collaborate fruitfully with the Department of Defense. Furthermore  aided by the ongoing growth of their military space cadres  collaboration with these countries can expand from a traditional focus on technical applications into combined education  doctrine  and policy. The thesis closes on a cautionary note  arguing that the Department of Defense needs to carefully consider how it will develop trust with foreign spacefaring militaries  with the Department of Commerce likely to assume responsibility for the foreign engagement associated with the United States' space situational awareness data-sharing agreements by 2024.""</p><p><br></p>",,"australia satellites,australia space,coalition,five eyes,france military,france space,isr,japan satellites,japan space,space,space force",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,124,Y,,,10-Nov-20,10-Nov-20,21.99,16.99,26.99,19.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,21.99,,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,19.95,19.95,21.99,21.99,21.99,21.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It also test the aerospace integration school's hypothesis that spacepower is simply a continuation or extension of airpower. Two points come immediately to the forefront of this work. First  spacepower is different from airpower even though both share the vertical dimension of warfare. Second  space operations have matured to a point where valid and unique propositions regarding spacepower are identifiable. The ten propositions presented here do not represent a complete list. The method used to derive these propositions involved literary research that result in a long list. The list evolved over three years during numerous brainstorming with several space experts--most of them space weapons officers with theater and often combat experience--until the list was carefully refined into the ten most salient propositions. There were many ways to present the Ten Propositions Regarding Spacepower  but the author deferred to Meininger's approach of citing each proposition as a thesis statement with supporting material immediately following.

As the author explains in the Abstract:</p><p><br></p><p>In 2008  the Independent Assessment Panel on the Organization and Management of National Security Space (NSS) reported to Congress that the military and intelligence space programs are fragmented  disorganized  inefficient  and ineffective. Without strong leadership and a unifying vision  the United State (US) space enterprise is losing its advantage over competing nations. The nation must address this erosion of capability with vigor in the near term. Inaction threatens US national interests. The US should create a separate military Department of the Space Force.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This work begins with a summary of the current strategic space environment  examines the fragmented state of the existing space enterprise  and establishes a framework for evaluating NSS. Having established the current NSS environment  it examines the genesis of the US Air Force (USAF). Air and airpower possess a set of specific characteristics that justify a distinct military service. This work then evaluates space and spacepower using the same series of attributes that validate a separate Air Force. Based on these attributes  the unique characteristics of space and space forces require the creation of a new Space Force. This work offers an organizational evolution for the current US space enterprise to address the significant issues that threaten the nation's ability to achieve national objectives. This necessary evolution is a Department of the Space Force.</p><p><br></p><p>This reproduction is printed with full color interior and a handsome  durable case laminate matte exterior.

The first assumption is that growing international activity  commerce  and industry in space extends the global commons  thus creating a military-economic imperative for the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to expand its protection of U.S. interests by defending space lines of communication. Although there are wide-ranging reasons to expand the space-faring capabilities of the human species  from the capitalistic to the existential  the fact of its occurrence offers the U.S. immense strategic opportunity.

SEALS  naval aviators  submariners  yes  to be sure  they're all very dashing and very brave--but PT boat crews stood in shirtsleeves on the decks of wooden speedboats and sprinted under heavy fire toward enemy warships a hundred times their size. They didn't have Kevlar vests  they didn't have air superiority  and they didn't have stealth technology. They took great risks  in person  at the height of WWII  at the times and in the theaters where the risk of defeat was at its highest. PT Boats fought it out with the enemy under heavy fire  often at night  against warships  planes  barges  and shore installations.</p><p><br></p><p>For quite a long time  PT boats and PT boat sailors were incredibly famous.&nbsp;Douglas Macarthur was rescued from the Phillippines aboard a PT boat.&nbsp;The most decorated PT boat captain  Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley  was awarded the Medal of Honor. During the war years PT boat images were plastered on every conceivable type of marketing paraphernalia.&nbsp;Arguably the most handsome and charismatic US President ever  John F. Kennedy  was a PT boat captain and hero. His boat  PT 109  and crew were prominently featured in his 1960 election campaign. Had he survived to serve out two terms and live the full life he deserved  we would still be reading about PT 109. Such is the power and fickleness of myth.</p><p><br></p><p>The artifacts that Frank shares with readers do a wonderful job of conveying the feeling of time and place. Myths can and should rise again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This book includes 239 color images with detailed captions.&nbsp;There is a Foreword by PT boat sailor and World War II veteran Arthur John Frongello  Quartermaster Third Class  who served aboard PT 302 as a member of Squadron 22.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Author Frank J. Andruss  Sr. writes in the Preface:</p><p><br></p><p>My passion for the history of the PT boats began as a very young child  when  in 1967  my Dad suggested that I watch the movie PT 109. This started my life-long journey in which as a young twenty-year-old I had the pleasure of meeting so many PT boat veterans and started to collect some of these treasured artifacts of the PT Navy. Over the years I would begin to create ""The Mosquito Fleet Exhibit"" in which I would use these artifacts to tell the story and provide the history that so many people did not know about.</p><p><br></p><p>It is my hope that  through these artifacts that were such a large part of PT history  this book brings new attention to the PT navy during World War II. In this book I hope to tell the stories of the brave sailors that served on the boats. PT boats played important roles from the first days of the war. They were in the Philippines  at Guadalcanal  at New Guinea  in the Med  at Surigao Strait. Their crews deserve to be remembered when World War II history is told.

Switching from the ""Asian miracle"" to the ""war on terror"", after 9/11 he covered the wars on Afghanistan and Iraq (before, during and after), energy wars and, in the Obama years, the American ""pivot"" to Asia. For the past few years, his focus is the Chinese-driven New Silk Roads, all aspects of Eurasia integration, and the geopolitical clash between the US and the Russia/China strategic partnership.
He has written columns and Op-Eds for dozens of online publications-including Al Jazeera, RT and Sputnik-and has been a frequent guest of TV and radio shows from North America to Asia. His articles/columns are regularly translated in several languages.

This volume includes 25 essays written for Asia Times  Consortium News  and Strategic Culture in the incomparable year of 2020 and adds a new introduction  afterword  and table of abbreviations. Educated people of all political persusasions will enjoy Escobar's stinging prose and his display of his wide-ranging and truly global knowledge of poetry  history  and political philosophy. American readers already skeptical of the dominant narrative will enjoy this scintillating dissection of the mammoth hypocrisy involved in the standard governmental and corporate narrative.  And those with perspectives similar to the American mainstream will benefit from reading a truly Other-centered exemplar of the several billion people who find the political perspectives that are commonplace in Asia  Europe  China  Russia  and Iran more congenial than those of a US establishment that has gifted the world with seventy-five-plus years of continuous war.  </p><p><br></p><p>Escobar's first book in the US   Globalistan (Nimble  2007)  brilliantly anticipated the future of a disintegrating international system in an era of ""Liquid"" (hybrid) war.

After a brief introduction and an explanation of the significance of Norway  Chapter Three will analyze the planning process and strategy used by the Germans in late 1939 and early 1940 for devising this joint operation. Chapter Four examines  primarily from an airpower perspective  the plan itself and its execution during the first day of the operation by the Germans  and the British response. Chapter Five determines how German airpower was used  and in particular  what effect the Luftwaffe attack on 9 April against the British Home Fleet had against Britain's campaign strategy to control the North Sea. The final chapter examines three important lessons United States military planners should extract from Operation Weseruebung and apply to operations in the 21st century. They are: 1) the joint operation of air  land  and sea assets produce a synergetic effect greater than the sum of their parts; 2) a difficult part of joint operations is the air command and control; and 3) airpower can decisively deny the enemy use of the land or the sea.,,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,48,,N,,7-Sep-10,30-Mar-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Military history contains many lessons from which the warfighting doctrine of the individual services  as well as joint doctrine  is derived. World War II stands as one of the major contributors of valuable lessons learned. From a joint and combined warfighting perspective  Germany's planning and preparatory military actions to the invasion of Great Britain after the fall of France
are instructive. Their plan  called Operation SEA LION by the Germans  was never carried out  as certain prerequisite conditions were never achieved  and Hitler elected to move on to other operations. But Germany could have been successful in invading and  if necessary  occupying Great Britain had they exercised joint and combined operations to achieve better unity of effort within the German military  remained focused on key British operational centers of gravity  and exploited the capabilities of friendly nations such as Spain  Italy  and the Vichy government of France.<p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,48,,N,,5-Oct-10,30-Mar-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

"Sea-Based Airpower - The Decisive Factor in Expeditionary Operations? (Norway, 1940; Falkland Islands, 1982)",9781608880232,1608880230,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Buhl, Willard A.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,HIS027140,HISTORY / Military / Aviation & Space,HIS027100,HISTORY / Wars & Conflicts / World War II / General,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Thesis: This essay examines the British use of sea-based aviation in support of two modern amphibious campaigns: the British campaign in Norway in 1940 and in the Falkland Islands War in 1982. The purpose is to determine whether or not aircraft carriers (sea-based aviation) were at the root of the success or failure of British efforts. <p>
Discussion: In April 1940  there were no airfields in central Norway capable of supporting modern  high performance aircraft. As the Norwegian campaign unfolded and the British faced a significant land-based air threat from the Luftwaffe  they failed to appreciate the tactical and operational potential of sea-based aviation. At the same time  British naval aircraft were technically inferior in design and capability compared to their Luftwaffe land-based counterparts in 1940. Nevertheless  despite determined attacks on British naval assets at the tactical level  at the operational level  the German command limited their campaign goals and did not exploit their advantage in the air to the extent possible. Their actions did  however  place great pressure on British sea based lines of communication in central Norway  the operational pivot of the campaign. In 1982  against the Argentines  the British faced another opponent with superior land-based aviation. Although the British fully appreciated the need for air superiority  they employed a tactical scheme not unlike what had occurred in Norway. Nevertheless  the British were able to successfully contest the airspace above the Falklands and ultimately succeeded in defeating Argentine ground forces and ejecting them from the islands.<p> 
Conclusions: Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) operations and sustainable littoral power projection will require versatile and flexible sea-based airpower. Much as the British expeditionary forces faced land-based airpower threats in Norway in 1940 and the Falkland Islands in 1982  U.S. aircraft carriers will be required to establish local air superiority over the fleet. Whereas land-based aircraft can attack fleets from great distances  current land-based fighters cannot protect the fleet from attack without extended aerial refueling. When air superiority cannot be maintained over the fleet  as evidenced in Norway and the Falklands  naval forces become prey to land-based airpower. Power projection from the sea occurs as a result of maintaining local air superiority  not in spite of it. Naval aviation exists to provide air superiority for naval fleets and sealift assets. Power projection from the sea is possible in large part because of air superiority. Until a space-based system capable of providing air superiority for ships at sea is fielded  ""legacy platforms"" such as aircraft carriers and their embarked air wings  despite their high cost  will remain essential naval warfare platforms. Further  however  and perhaps of greatest importance to this study  amphibious forces ashore cannot rely on aircraft carrier (sea-based) air support if a credible land-based aircraft or missile threat to supporting aircraft carriers exists.",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,64,,N,,9-Apr-10,31-Mar-10,17.99,13.99,22.99,15.99,23.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,17.99,,16.55,17.99,17.99,17.99,16.55,16.55,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The German Navy was stripped of its battleships  submarines  and aircraft. The effort to rebuild began immediately following the war. The decision about what direction and shape the Navy would take was influenced by several factors. The German Navy's anticipated enemy  the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles  and the political situation all played a part in the development of the post-World War I German Navy. At least as important as any of these factors was the influence of two prominent naval theorists  A.T. Mahan  and Sir Julian Corbett. This thesis examined the extent that the theories of Mahan and Corbett influenced the development of German Naval Strategy between 1930 and 1936. The period includes the remnants of the Weimar Republic  the ascension of Adolf Hitler  and the signing of the Anglo-German Naval agreement in 1935  and finally the first of naval developments after the treaty. <p>

Yet the German airborne branch literally self-destructed in 1941. What happened  how did the Germans react  and what historical insights in the use of airborne forces can modern day planners derive from the German experience? <p>
In the late 1930's  an aggressive and innovative rearmament program in Nazi Germany gave rise to the tactics of vertical envelopment. Pioneering the use of gliders as troop carriers  parachutists  and the air landing of reinforcements to exploit tactical success  the German Wehrmacht used the new technique of airborne warfare with startling success as part of the Blitzkrieg campaign against the Low Countries and France in 1940. When the tactical doctrine used to seize bridges  strong points and road junctions in Fall Gelb was transferred to the seizure of an entire island that was heavily defended in 1941  however  the German airborne effectively committed suicide. In ten days in May 1941  half the airborne forces in the entire German army were killed or wounded on Crete. Hitler wrongly ascribed the disaster to a playing out of the surprise factor  and banned further parachute operations until 1943. The right conclusions were arrived at by the commander of the German airborne himself  General Kurt Student  in post-battle analysis. His own insistence on faulty tactics was devastating. Although they remained a potent and professional force  Hitler's effective ban on the future use of airborne forces lasted until 1943  when it was clear the Allies still very much considered paratroops a viable form of warfare. By then  Germany's ability to conduct airborne operations on a significant scale had long since passed.  <p>
The German innovation of vertical envelopment in the 1930's was as revolutionary to modern military tactics as the simultaneous development of the integrated combined arms offensive known today as the Blitzkrieg. In putting Billy Mitchell's ideas into practice  Luftwaffe General Student demonstrated vision  innovative thinking and practical military skill. Poor intelligence and reliance on his ""spreading oil drops"" tactics for the deployment of his paratroopers  the Fallschirmtruppe  on Crete  however  led directly to their removal as a significant weapon from the German arsenal in World War II. Nevertheless  Student proved that airborne troops have unique capabilities as a force multiplier in both offensive and defensive warfare. The German experience  which also demonstrated the limitations of airborne forces  was studied in depth by the U.S. Army after the war and incorporated into airborne doctrine.  <p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,60,,N,,20-May-10,9-Apr-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Consequently  the tactical commander  Freyberg  was unable to organize  equip and resource his defense properly.<p>
Alied strategy was unsuccessful for two reasons. First  the development of Allied strategy resembled that of a pinball game rather than a deliberative  objectives-based process.  Rather than forcing the Germans into a predictable move  counter-move contest  the indecisive Allied strategy caused them to out-maneuver themselves resulting in available Allied combat power going unemployed. Second  an overall lack of unity of command plagued the implementation of strategies. Polliticians  the General Staff and subordinate commanders who disagreed with the strategy did their best to derail or not support it. Not only were the Allies strategically out-maneuvered due to these factors  but the consequences of these strategic errors were visited on operational and tactical units in dramatic fashion. The operational ommanders tasked to provide forces  equipment  resources and support to the effort considered Greece and eventually Crete economy of force operations and released resources without reducing their own capabilities.<p>
The Allies failed to clearly define  articulate  and implement the strategic objectives of their entry into Greece. As a result  subordinate commanders were unable to create operational level unity of command and to synchronize their efforts to achieve the Allied objectives. Consequently  CreForce and Freyberg were unable to obtain  organize and synchronize the elements of combat power necessary to defend Crete and lost the battle.<p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,72,,N,,20-May-10,13-Apr-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The formative period ran from 1940 through May 1941  while the expansion period extended into 1943.  A major point of departure and comparison was the German invasion of Crete in May 1941 (Operation Merkur)  which lent important impetus to U.S> airborne development. Without knowledge of the severity of German losses at Crete and the shortcomings in airborne doctrine that the German experience exposed  U.S. planners accepted Crete as their model on which to base rapid airborne expansion.

"Self-Inflicted Wound Allied Defeat in Crete, May 1941",9781608880379,1608880370,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Kostic, Samuel J.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027100,HISTORY / Wars & Conflicts / World War II / General,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Leadership failures in the defense of Crete were essential factors contributing to Allied defeat on the island in May 1941. <p>
The Germans appeared unstoppable during the early stages of World War II. Inexperienced Allied forces were willing to fight  but the sentiment was the Germans were too powerful. Defeat became a foregone conclusion. To defend at all costs no longer appeared viable. Withdrawal and evacuation seemed almost commonplace in Allied strategy. 
Great Britain and Germany identified early in the war the strategic importance of the island of Crete for conducting military operations in the Mediterranean. Operationally the British maintained naval supremacy in the Mediterranean  while the German Luftwaffe ruled the skies. <p>
The Allies began defending Crete in November 1940. However  the Middle East Command put little effort into defending the island and changed Crete Force Commanders on a monthly basis. Allied intelligence uncovered the details of the German invasion plan for Crete. In a last ditch effort  forces evacuated from Greece were sent to Crete to bolster the defenses. This brought the total number of Allied defenders to 42 500 to repel an estimated enemy assault of 5 000 men. <p>
The German plan for the occupation of Crete  Operation MERCURY  called for gliders and Hitler's elite paratroops to conduct the largest airborne operation to date. The plan pitted 22 000 men and 1280 aircraft against an erroneously estimated enemy strength of 5 000 men. The success of this plan relied upon surprise and the paratroops securing one of the three airfields on the island so reinforcements could be flown in. <p>
A reluctant Crete Force Commander set the tone for subordinate commanders' leadership failures. The invasion began the morning of 20 May 1941. The Germans suffered heavy casualties. At the end of the first day of fighting  they were short ammunition  and the Allies maintained control of the airfields. However  the battalion commander defending the airfield at Maleme  lacking communications and situational awareness  was unaware of the success of his unit and that night mistakenly ordered its withdrawal from the airfield. The Germans occupied the airfield in the morning and reinforcements were flown in. The Allies conducted an attack the night of 21 May to retake the airfield  but poor Allied leadership at the Brigade and Division level resulted in failure. Consequently  the Germans were able to mass combat power on the island and defeat the Allies.<p>
The defenders outnumbered the attackers nearly 2 to 1  knew the invasion plan  and established their defense accordingly. By all accounts  the Allies should have defeated the Germans and in fact came quite close to doing so. However  failures in Allied leadership afforded the Germans opportunities that were quickly exploited. Subsequently  they were able to defeat the Allies within 12 days. Failure in Allied leadership  not overwhelming German combat power  was responsible for the Allied defeat on Crete.",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,62,,N,,20-May-10,16-Apr-10,11.99,8.99,14.99,10.99,15.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,11.99,,11.05,11.99,11.99,11.99,11.05,11.05,11.99,11.99,11.99,11.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

By their inability to achieve surprise  concentrate their forces to realize a single purpose  and control the tempo of the attack to retain the initiative  the Germans paratroops were decimated  and only through air superiority and poor Allied leadership were they able to defeat the Allies.<p> 
On 21 May  1941 German paratroopers conducted an airborne invasion of the battle of Crete. Rather than being a part of a coherent strategy to defeat the Allies in the Mediterranean  this attack was merely an attempt for Hitler to shore up his southern flank before invading Russia. The author of the airborne plan  General Kurt Student  wanted to prove that airborne troops could be used operationally and drew up the plan to attack Crete with paratroopers and air landed elite mountain troops supported by seaborne reinforcements. Lacking proper resources to conduct the attack and with only three weeks to plan  Student developed a plan to attack the island at four widespread locations. He envisioned complete surprise and failed to make any contingency plans. The Allies defending Crete  having the benefit of intercepted German communications  were prepared for the attack  but lacked the necessary weapons and supplies to properly defend the island. Ten days later the Germans had captured the island  but at a cost of over 6 000 German troops and over 170 transport aircraft. <p>

In Student's rush to prove to the Fuhrer the operational benefit of an airborne force  he ignored key principles of the offense and thus destroyed the very force he advocated. In the end  it was the individual paratrooper that brought Student his victory  but at a terrible cost. Although this Promethean event was an operational and tactical victory for the Germans  it was a Pyrrhic one at best  and Crete would forever be known as the ""graveyard of the Fallschirmjäger.<p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,48,,N,,20-May-10,19-Apr-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Napoleon  however  changed all of this and in a few short years transformed the French army into the most powerful force on the continent of Europe. During the period of 1805 to 1813  Napoleon's army had no equal with regard to operational effectiveness. Speed and positioning of forces were the two main characteristics that made the French army so successful. These same two characteristics were also inherent to French cavalry units. Thus  the central research question is: What influence did cavalry have upon Napoleon's operations? To facilitate this study  two campaigns were examined that illustrate cavalry's impact on Napoleon's operations. The first campaign was the Jena Campaign of 1806; the second was the Saxony Campaign of 1813. The Jena Campaign demonstrated that with the employment of sufficient and well-trained cavalry  Napoleon could render his victories decisive through the complete destruction of the enemy army. Conversely  the Saxony Campaign demonstrated that without the effective employment of sufficient and well-trained cavalry  Napoleon could not obtain the complete destruction of the enemy army and thus  his victories were hollow  or at best Pyrrhic. Therefore  based on the analysis of these two campaigns  this study has concluded that Napoleon's cavalry was a key element for Napoleon achieving complete destruction of the enemy army  thus rendering his victories decisive.,,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,114,,N,,13-Jul-10,21-Apr-10,20.99,15.99,25.99,18.99,27.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,20.99,,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,19.05,19.05,20.99,20.99,20.99,20.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Thousands of pictures are preserved in the photographic libraries of the armed services but are little seen by the public. <p>
In the narrative volumes of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II  now being prepared by the Office of the Chief of Military History of the United States Army  it is possible to include only a limited number of pictures. Therefore  a subseries of pictorial volumes  of which this is the last  has been planned to supplement the other volumes of the series. The photographs have been especially selected to show important terrain features  types of equipment and weapons  living and weather conditions  military operations  and matters of human interest. These volumes will preserve and make accessible for future reference some of the best pictures of World War II. An appreciation not only of the terrain upon which actions were fought  but also of its influence on the capabilities and limitations of weapons in the hands of both our troops and those of the enemy  can be gained through a careful study of the pictures herein presented. These factors are essential to a clear understanding of military history. The text was written and the photographs compiled by Capt. Kenneth E. Hunter and Miss Margaret E. Tackley; the volume was edited by Miss Mary Ann Bacon. The book deals with the Pacific Theater of Operations and is divided into six sections: (1) The Allied Defensive; (2) The Strategic Defensive and Tactical Offensive; (3) The Offensive-1944; (4) The Final Phase; (5) The China-Burma-India Theater; and (6) The Collapse of Japan and the End of the War in the Pacific. Each section is arranged in chronological order. All dates used are local dates  and it should be remembered that all dates west of the International Date Line are one day ahead of those east of the line. For example  7 December 1941 at Pearl Harbor is the same day as 8 December 1941 in the Philippines. <p>
The written text has been kept to a minimum.

The invasion of Crete was executed from 20 May to 1 June 1941 with heavy German losses. The invasion of Malta never took place even though the senior military leaders in the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) recommended invading Malta over Crete because of its strategic importance  but were overridden by Adolf Hitler. A year later  while the North Africa campaign was being conducted  another invasion was planned for Malta  but within a few weeks of executing the plan it too was postponed and eventually cancelled.Why was Crete invaded in 1941  but Malta was not? Why in 1942 was a second planned invasion of Malta rejected and abandoned  and what were the strategic repercussions of not invading Malta?

It was a crime. <p>

From the planning of aggression in 2002 through years of hostile military occupation  the United States systematically violated the United Nations Charter  the Geneva Conventions and virtually every principle of international law and order.<p>

America's crimes against the people of Iraq were shielded from public scrutiny by what senior U.S. military officers called the ""quiet  disguised  media-free approach"" developed in Central America in the 1980s.  The echo chamber of the Western corporate media fleshed out the Pentagon's propaganda to create a virtual Iraq in the minds of the public  feeding a political discourse that bore no relation to the real war it was waging  the country it was destroying or the lives of its inhabitants.<p>

In an easily readable and flowing narrative  Nicolas Davies has carefully taken apart the wall of propaganda surrounding one of history's most significant military disasters and most serious international crimes: non-existent WMDs; the equally fictitious ""centuries-old sectarian blood feud"" in Iraq; and the secrecy of the dirty war waged by American-led death squads.

987-foot tank vessel Exxon Valdez struck Bligh
Reef in Prince William Sound  Alaska. What
followed was the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
The oil slick has spread over 3 000 square miles and
onto over 350 miles of beaches in Prince William
Sound  one of the most pristine and magnificent
natural areas in the country. Experts still are
assessing the environmental and economic
implications of the incident. The job of cleaning
up the spill is under way  and although the initial
response proceeded slowly  major steps have been
taken.<p>
The very large spill size  the remote location 
and the character of the oil all tested spill
preparedness and response capabilities. Government
and industry plans  individually and collectively 
proved to be wholly insufficient to control an oil
spill of the magnitude of the Exxon Valdez
incident. Initial industry efforts to get equipment
on scene were unreasonably slow  and once
deployed the equipment could not cope with the
spill. Moreover  the various contingency plans did
not refer to each other or establish a workable
response command hierarchy. This resulted in
confusion and delayed the cleanup.<p>
Prepared by the National Response Team  this
report was requested by the President and
undertaken by Secretary of Transportation Samuel
K. Skinner and Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator William K. Reilly. The report
addresses the preparedness for  the response to  and
early lessons learned from the Exxon Valdez
incident. The President has also asked Secretary
Skinner to coordinate the efforts of all federal
agencies involved in the cleanup and Administrator
Reilly to coordinate the long-term recovery of the
affected areas of the Alaskan environment. These
efforts are ongoing.<p>

Rise of the Drones: Unmanned Systems and the Future of War,9781608880508,1608880508,Available for Printing/Download,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"U. S. House of Representatives, House Of",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027140,HISTORY / Military / Aviation & Space,TEC025000,TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Military Science,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Over the last decade  the number of unmanned systems and their applications has grown rapidly. So too has the number of operational  political  and legal questions associated with this technology. The growing demand for and reliance on unmanned systems has serious implications  both on and off the battlefield. <p>
As the United States is engaged in two wars abroad  unmanned systems  particularly unmanned aerial vehicles  have become a centerpiece of that war effort. In recent years  the Department of Defense's UAV inventory has rapidly grown in size  from 167 in 2002 to over seven thousand today. Last year  for the first time  the U.S. Air Force trained more unmanned pilots than traditional fighter pilots. <p>
Some express no doubt that unmanned systems have been a boost to U.S. war efforts in the Middle East and South Asia. CIA Director Leon Panetta said last May that ""drone strikes are the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership."" Media reports over the last year that the top two leaders of the Pakistani Taliban were killed by drone strikes also support this argument. <p>
But some critics argue that drone strikes are unethical at best and counterproductive at worst. They point to the reportedly high rate of civilian casualties  which has been calculated by the New American Foundation to be around 32 percent  and argue that the strikes do more to stoke anti-Americanism than they do to weaken our enemies. A quick skim of any Pakistani newspaper provides some evidence to support this theory. This is particularly relevant in the era of counter-insurgency doctrine  a central tenet of which is  'first  do no harm.' <p>
It also may be the case that we are fighting wars with modern technology under an antiquated set of laws. For example  if the United States uses unmanned weapons systems  does that require an official declaration of war or an authorization for the use of force? <p>",,,B&W 8.25 x 11 in or 280 x 210 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,128,,N,,31-May-10,28-Jul-10,18.99,13.99,22.99,16.99,24.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,18.99,,16.95,18.99,18.99,18.99,16.95,16.95,18.99,18.99,18.99,18.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

While conventional naval warfare holds the premier position in naval affairs  MIW constitutes a less understood but equally important other tradition that merits closer attention. History demonstrates a link between the evolution of regular naval warfare and its irregular counterpart. when fully understood and correctly utilized  MIW actions have proven extremely effective at providing unconventional solutions to complex military problems. Consistently  MIW forces have powerfully affected the outcomes of conflict both at sea and on land. Through the skillful employment of MIW  this long historical pattern can continue to affect conflicts of the 21st century. In an era of rapid change  the ability to clearly identify and understand emerging trends in conflict and military affairs is an essential element in assessing MIW's future. As conventional warfare begins to realign for future threats  practitioners of MIW need to begin thinking proactively about how MIW can stay relevant and the concerted actions that need to be taken in order to fit into the future of warfare.

For years  North Korea's military provocations have been obvious to the world  however  much of its decisionmaking is shrouded in secrecy  particularly that of a wide-range of clandestine activities. This monograph is unique in the way that it sheds light on the illicit activities of the regime  and how those illegal activities are used to support its military programs and the government itself. From drug trafficking to counterfeiting  from money laundering to cigarette smuggling  North Korea's Central Committee Bureau 39 is an active participant in the criminal economy of the region with tentacles extending well beyond Asia. The authors discuss how these activities have negative strategic consequences for a number of stakeholders and nations throughout the region while describing how such activities provide critical funding streams for military programs and regime supporters. As a result  North Korea is not just a ""rogue state "" but practices what is essentially criminal sovereignty whereby it organizes its illegitimate activities behind the shield of non-intervention while using the tools of the state to perpetrate these schemes abroad. The authors argue that this arrangement has important links to succession issues within the regime. They also argue that policy makers who are concerned with the development of future policies and strategies aimed toward North Korea must view those new policies from a different perspective than that used in the past.",,,B&W 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,46,,,,8-Jun-10,29-Jul-10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

The Royal Air Force adopted the offensive use of airpower to attack enemy sources power as its primary mission and focused on defeating the enemy nation. Great Britain's national strategic situation  its lessons from World War I  and its air leadership all contributed toward this adoption. The Germansituation was different. Its lessons from World War I  its traditional views on the roles of its army  its strategic situation  and its fragmented air leadership contributed toward its adoption of an air doctrine that focused on defeating enemy military forces  not enemy sources of power. The Treaty of Versailles also restricted the size of its military and the kinds of aircraft it could build  affecting its air force's mission. This thesis addresses the development of a new technology and its adoption as either a doctrinal evolution or revolution.

Manual (FM) 100-5  Operations  introduced to the
English-speaking world the idea of an operational level
of war which encompassed the planning and conduct
of campaigns and major operations. It was followed 3
years later by the introduction of the term ""operational
art"" which was  in practice  the skillful management
of the operational level of war. This conception of
an identifiably separate level of war that defined
the jurisdiction of the profession of arms was  for a
number of historical and cultural reasons  attractive to
U.S. practitioners and plausible to its English-speaking
allies. As a result  it and its associated doctrine spread
rapidly around the world.<p>
This monograph argues that the idea of an
operational level of war charged with the planning and
conduct of campaigns misconceives the relationship
between wars  campaigns  and operations  and is both
historically mistaken and wrong in theory. Brigadier
Justin Kelly (Australian Army Retired) and Dr. Michael
Brennan conclude that its incorporation into U.S.
doctrine has had the regrettable impact of separating
the conduct of campaigns from the conduct of wars
and consequently marginalized the role of politics in
the direction of war. In essence  they argue that the
idea of the campaign has come to overwhelm that of
strategy.<p>
This monograph argues that as warfare continues to
diffuse across definitional and conceptual boundaries
and as the close orchestration of all of the instruments
of national power becomes even more important 
the current conception of campaigns and operations
becomes crippling. To cope with these demands by
formulating and prosecuting ""national campaigns ""
the authors propose that the responsibility for
campaign design should ""actually"" return to the
political-strategic leadership of nations supported by
the entirety of the state bureaucracy. This would mark
the return of the campaign to its historical sources. If
the United States and its allies fail to make this change 
they risk continuing to have a ""way of battle"" rather
than a ""way of war.""

In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in order to end the ability of the Taliban regime to provide safe haven to al Qaeda and to put a stop to al Qaeda's use of the territory of Afghanistan as a base of operations for terrorist activities. In that first phase  U.S. and coalition forces  working with Afghan opposition forces  quickly removed the Taliban regime. <p>
After the fall of the Taliban  the character of the war shifted to a multifaceted COIN effort aimed at smothering the diffuse insurgency by shoring up GIRoA efforts to provide security  governance  and economic development. The three areas are generally viewed as interdependent and mutually-reinforcing-security is a prerequisite for some governance and development efforts  and longer-term  sustainable security requires both functional governance and economic opportunity. As one pillar of the COIN campaign in Afghanistan  the Afghan and international military effort aims broadly at defeating the remnants of the Taliban and other insurgents  securing the population  and helping extend the reach of the Afghan government. The international military effort includes both the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)  to which the United States contributes troops  and the separate U.S.-led OEF mission. <p>
In his December 3  2009  speech President Obama identified several objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan: (1) disrupt  dismantle  and defeat al Qaeda; (2) deny al Qaeda a safe haven; (3) reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the government; and (4) strengthen the capacity of the Afghan security forces and government to better protect and serve population centers. To accomplish this  President Obama ordered the deployment of an additional 30 000 troops to the region  which will bring the U.S. total to almost 100 000 troops. This deployment will be staged over several months  with the full additional complement being in-country by the end of the summer 2010. Noting that Afghan operations continue to be an international effort  President Obama expressed confidence that some of 42 coalition allies will also be increasing their contributions. NATO Secretary-General Rasmussen echoed this confidence  stating that he expects NATO allies to contribute at least an additional 5 000 troops in 2010. <p>

the initiative of the Department of the Army in 1983 to develop the force
structure for 10 000-man light infantry divisions. Its goals were to
provide annotated historical references for the combat experiences of
previous light divisions and to list historical sources on the force design
process  especially in regard to attempts to lighten the force or to respond
to improvements in technology on the battlefield. The first draft of this
bibliography was distributed in September and October 1983 as a quick
reference to force planners across the Army.

Since that time  the bibliography has been expanded  but the general
focus remains the same  historical light divisions and the force design
process. It addresses light infantry forces of the twentieth century with
primary emphasis on World War II and later. This document can serve as a
starting point for force designers' research into the origins 
organizations  capabilities  and combat experiences of light infantry forces.
In order to permit widespread distribution of this bibliography  only
unclassified sources have been cited. However  additional classified
documents on the subject exist  particularly in regard to technical analyses
of force capabilities. A number of these are available in the Combined Arms
Research Library (CARL) at Fort Leavenworth  Kansas.

The continuing usefulness of light forces goes beyond their ease of deployment. Light infantry exemplifies a state of mind that reveals itself in a unique tactical style  versatility  and elan that are so vital in battle.<p>
While the structure of light infantry makes it admirably equipped to fight in restricted terrain  it operates at considerable disadvantage in areas more suited to heavy forces. As with any military organization  commanders must consider both the capabilities and limitations of light infantry before committing it to battle. Major Scott R  McMichael provides a valuable historical perspective for understanding the characteristics  organization  and operations of light infantry forces.<p>
Major McMichael's Research Survey examines four light infantry forces operating in varying settings: the Chindits in the 1944 Burma campaign against the Japanese: the Chinese Communist Forces during the Korean War; British operations in Malaya and Borneo from 1948 to 1966: and the First Special Service Force in its battles in the mountains of Itali during World War II.  These examples are diverse in terms of time  areas of operations  and opposing forces  yet they reveal common characteristics of light forces and their operations.<p>
A Historical Perspective on Light Infantry is based on extensive research in primary and secondary historical sources. The author has uncovered numerous doctrinal and operational manuals and reports and has gone beyond them to explore the more personal side of light infantry operations. This study is both fascinating reading and a valuable historica  analysis of the capabilities and limitations of light infantry when faced with the test of battle. <p>",,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,252,,N,,30-Jun-10,9-Jul-10,19.99,14.99,24.99,17.99,26.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,19.99,,18.19,19.99,19.99,19.99,18.19,18.19,19.99,19.99,19.99,19.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem is the collection of official  proxy  and unattributed communication channels and platforms that Russia uses to create and amplify false narratives. The ecosystem consists of five main pillars: official government communications  state-funded global messaging  cultivation of proxy sources  weaponization of social media  and cyber-enabled disinformation. The Kremlin bears direct responsibility for cultivating these tactics and platforms as part of its approach to using information as a weapon. It invests massively in its propaganda channels  its intelligence services and its proxies to conduct malicious cyber activity to support their disinformation eforts  and it leverages outlets that masquerade as news sites or research institutions to spread these false and misleading narratives. This report also focuses specific attention on Russia's tactic of leveraging proxy voices that proliferate pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda.

September 11 and crises like it are matters that grab all of our hearts.  Adrienne Redd was a mom (and sociology professor) when the events of September 11  2001 transpired. That day led her on a seven-year journey to make  sense of changing political order and earn a doctoral degree.  She has a down-to-earth approach to political scholarship.

How are global events eroding and pressuring traditional political institutions  such as the nation?  Her book offers an affirmative rather than doomsday picture of how the public and our leaders need to re-think how the world is organized at the highest levels.   

Fallen Walls and Fallen Towers describes in entertaining terms how the nation was conceived about 350 years ago  how it grew to meet the needs of the industrial age  how it is being threatened by several trends of globalization  and how ordinary people and leaders really can influence its survival by how they think and talk about national government. In what ways do people have to reconsider fundamental concepts like boundaries and sovereignty in order to foster future social stability?

He has been on the staffs of Navy Operational Support Centers in Des Moines IA, Brunswick ME, Rochester NY, Battle Creek MI, and on the staff of the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Bath ME. He has made four overseas deployments to Japan and the western Pacific, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Gulf of Aden. He retired from active duty in August, 2019.His awards include the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal, Navy Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service Medals, Armed Forces Reserve Medal w/ ""M"" device, and a COMSUBGRU 7 Letter of Commendation. Chief Johnston is qualified in submarines and surface warfare.During a break in service in the 1990s, he worked in the travel, security, and retail industries.He resides in Norfolk, Virginia with his wife Theresa.","Born and raised in the state of Washington, Ric was primarily brought up in the Seattle area. After high school graduation in 1964 he enlisted in the Navy and attended boot camp and ""A"" school in San Diego, CA where he volunteered for duty in submarines. After attending Submarine School at Submarine Base New Lon-don in Groton CT in 1965, he was assigned to the pre-commissioning crew of the Thresher class submarine USS Flasher (SSN-613), under construction at General Dynamics/Electric Boat in Groton, CT. After commissioning Flasher changed homeports to Hawaii, and from there Ric deployed on numerous patrols to the northern, western and central Pacific. After slightly over four years on active du-ty, he transitioned to the Navy Reserve and was assigned to the Submarine Re-serve Unit in Seattle, where he completed his six-year military obligation. During this period, he performed temporary duty on the diesel submarine USS Cusk (SS-348), shortly before her decommissioning.His service awards include the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation Ribbon, Navy Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Korean Defense Service Medal. He is qualified in submarines.While in civilian life he worked in various professions, learning skills that later served him well. An avid sailor, he operated his own business performing yacht and small boat repair, and lived on and operated his own sailboat for ten years. Transitioning jobs once again, he spent 14 years in the Bio-Tech industry in the Materials Management role, taking several companies from their startup phases into Food &amp; Drug Administration-approved production of their products.","Jim Christley retired from the US Navy in 1982 as a senior chief petty officer, having served on seven submarines ranging from diesel to nuclear fast attacks to ballistic missile boats.

The cause was an electrical malfunction that created a series of explosions. The high ambient temperature made the fire even more dangerous  and the lack of effective firefighting measures made it all but impossible to stop. The board of investigation that followed determined that no disciplinary action was warranted against any personnel.

The Ship Killers: The Definitive Illustrated History of the Torpedo Boat,9781934840429,1934840424,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,Omnibus Edition,0,"Hinds, Joe",,,Author,,,"Joe Hinds illustrated works of military interest for more than 40 years.Mr. Hinds served as an illustrator in the United States Marines and the United States Navy from 1965 to 1980 and again in the Naval Reserves from 1990 to 1996 in support of Operations of Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During his military career he served on the aircraft carriers USS Coral Sea and USS Enterprise and later at the Naval Weapons Test Center, Port Hueneme, California. He also worked on the first cruise missile tests in what would become the Tomahawk program.Mr. Hinds grew up in Needles, California. In this desert river town he was greatly influenced by the National Speed Boat Races. These events featured small, fast boats that were civilian echoes of the torpedo boats of the world's navies.Mr. Hinds was involved in both technical and editorial illustration. His career includes working in the business community as an independent graphics project manager, illustrator and designer for American Honda Motor Company, British Petroleum/HITCO, Martin Marietta, Grey Advertising, BBDO Los Angeles and others. His art appeared in magazines such as Private Pilot, Plane and Pilot, Cycle World, Civil War Times Illustrated, America in World War II, and others.In pursuit of historical accuracy, he was  fortunate to work with distinguished museum curators, Joe Judge (Curator, Hampton Roads Naval Museum), Bob Holcombe (Curator, Confederate Naval Museum, and Dana Wegner (Curator, US Navy Ships Model Museum. Mr. Hinds has also worked closely with Jeff Johnston, Program Specialist and Dr. John Broadwater, Manager of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary-NOAA. This collaborative effort led to illustrations of the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia (ex-Merrimack). These illustration, sold as prints, show numerous details of these two historic vessels that have never been shown before. Mr. Hinds' illustrations of several Civil War vessels appeared In Civil War Times magazine from 1999 to 2006. At that same time he began work with the Discovery Channel to produce an accurate illustration of the US Navy Civil War submarine Alligator. This illustration was subsequently used by NOAA as an international distributed poster to celebrate the achievements of the USS Alligator during the American Civil War. This illustration was produced with the aid of master model builders and submarine historians, a necessity since no contemporary plans or photographs of the Alligator exist. The final product produced by Mr. Hinds was used in television productions, posters and other products.Mr. Hinds has completed the first comprehensive treatment of torpedo boats. This monumental research effort on the development of the torpedo boat in the world's navies has produced a series of illustrations and narrative accounts, as well as voluminous research files. Hinds have pushed back the timeline on the invention of the torpedo to 1280 AD thanks to assistance from Dr. Ahmad Y. Al-Hussan, Cambridge University. One part of the effort, the story of PT-34, recently appeared in the magazine America in World War II with a second article detailing the second PT boat heroic action by President John F. Kennedy.By combining his avocation for naval history with his vocation in illustrating, Mr. Hinds made lasting contributions to the history of the world's navies.",,,HIS027340,HISTORY / Military / Vehicles / Sea (see also TRANSPORTATION / Ships & Shipbuilding / Submarines),HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,TEC060000,TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Marine & Naval,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,<p>Volume 1: Overview</p><p>Volume 2: Timeline 1585 - 1899</p><p>Volume 3: Timeline 1900 - 1939</p><p>Volume 3: Timeline 1900-August 1939</p><p>Volume 4: Timeline September 1939-1940</p><p>Volume 5: Timeline 1941</p><p>Volume 6: Timeline 1942</p><p>Volume 7: Timeline 1943</p><p>Volume 8: Timeline 1944</p><p>Volume 9: Timeline 1945</p><p><br></p><p>Appendices and special features from Volumes 10 and 11 include:</p><p><br></p><p><em>CSS (Confederate States Ship) David Class Torpedo Boat: 1863</em></p><p><em>USN Torpedo Boat No.5  Spuyten Duyvil</em></p><p><em>The Herreshoff Brothers</em></p><p><em>The Torpedo Boat Winslow  TB-5</em></p><p><em>The Raven's Wrath</em></p><p>Appendix A.

This second edition Fowler brothers  Henry Watson Fowler and Francis George Fowler  and published in 1908  and thus pre-dates by almost years Modern English Usage  which was written by Henry alone after Francis's death in 1918. This is a facsimile version of the 1922 printing by Oxford University Press.<p>

The King's English is less like a dictionary than Modern English Usage; it consists of longer articles on more general topics such as vocabulary  syntax and punctuation  and draws heavily on examples from many sources throughout. One of its sections is a systematic description of the appropriate uses of shall and will. The third and last edition was published in 1931  by which time Modern English Usage had superseded it in popularity.<p>

Because all living languages continually evolve  the book is now considered outdated in some respects; and some of the Fowlers' opinions about correct English usage are at times incorrect with regard to contemporary standards. For example  the Fowlers disapprove of the word ""concision"" on the grounds that it had a technical meaning in theology  ""to which it may well be left""; although ""concision"" is now a common synonym for ""conciseness""  it is still an ugly word. The Fowlers also criticised the use of standpoint and just how much (as in ""Just how much more of this can we take?"")  describing them as undesirable ""Americanisms""  but both are now common in British English. The book nevertheless remains a benchmark for usage. Every wordlover should have a copy.",,,"B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Blue Digital Cloth!

He felt that a better understanding of these terms would lead to a greater appreciation of Italy's rich maritime history.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">  Italy was beginning her growth into one nation-state for which she needed a navy with an intellectual foundation-a navy fully equipped with officers who were cross-trained as engineers/seamen/soldiers-which both Cavour's politics and Guglielmotti's efforts contributed greatly toward enabling. It is apparent that this book was written at that historic moment when Italy embarked on building such an apparatus which required that she first construct a new vocabulary within which her people might also learn how best to interact with others around them-even those outside Italy proper. Therefore there was &nbsp;a need for a changeover from what had been primarily a defensive emphasis on her thinking about warships up until then toward an offensive capability so that she might sail out upon the seas.</p><p class=""ql-align-justify"">  Guglielmotti believed that a classical education was essential for a proper understanding of naval terminology.

The Navy is engaging in interoperability exercises and drills with allies and partners across both land and sea  all with a singular purpose - to ensure safety and security for all involved.The author for this work - the US Department of the Navy - is perfectly suited to tell such a tale: they are experts in both maritime affairs and Arctic operations as well as renowned global policymakers.

Meanwhile  we learn about current events related to international relations occurring above water - such as increased tension with Russia - that are just as vital when it comes to ensuring everyone remains safe while exploring new horizons.Discovering the strategic maneuverings around the Earth's Seventh Sea should not only create excitement but also consider the issue more broadly-what other new strategic theatres will open up in the remainder of the 21st Century?

It was an unprecedented attack on our democracy and its devastating consequences are still reverberating throughout our country. In the days that followed  it has become clear that prior to this tragic event  several federal agencies identified credible threats leading up to the MAGA I and MAGA II demonstrations in Washington D.C.  yet many questions remain about how those threats were assessed and responded to.</p><p><br></p><p>The General Accounting Office (GAO) report 'Capitol Attack' dives deep into these questions using open source data and related threat products to investigate what went wrong. Their findings show a complex web of intelligence gathering from multiple teams that was considered by some personnel but not acted upon until it was too late. With clarity borne from unwavering dedication to uncovering the truth - no matter how inconvenient or uncomfortable - GAO's careful analysis shines a light on weaknesses in both communication infrastructure as well as internal processes used for threat assessment at federal agencies spanning multiple administrations.

The report identifies key factors such as non-compliant DeFi services  disintermediation  a lack of implementation of international anti-money laundering/counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in foreign countries  and cybersecurity weaknesses in DeFi services that continue to pose vulnerabilities that enable criminal use of DeFi services.</p><p><br></p><p>The report highlights the vulnerabilities and potential exploits in open-source code  which can lead to widespread exploits if code reused in multiple DeFi services contains vulnerabilities. The public availability of many DeFi services' source code also presents the opportunity for other persons to reuse the code in smart contracts for a separate DeFi service. The document emphasizes that it is critical that the DeFi service identifies and addresses vulnerabilities and potential exploits in open-source code.</p><p><br></p><p>Color interior.</p><p><br></p><p>The report recommends several actions to address these risks  including strengthening AML/CFT supervision of virtual asset activities  assessing possible enhancements to the U.S. AML/CFT regulatory regime as applied to DeFi services  continuing research and private sector engagement to support understanding of developments in the DeFi ecosystem  continuing to engage with foreign partners  advocating for cyber resilience in virtual asset firms  testing of code  and robust threat information sharing  and promoting responsible innovation of mitigation measures.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall  the report concludes that DeFi poses significant illicit finance risks and calls for increased regulatory oversight and collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to address these risks. The report also poses several questions for consideration  such as what factors should be considered to determine whether DeFi services are a financial institution under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)  how can the U.S. government encourage the adoption of measures to mitigate illicit finance risks  and how should AML/CFT obligations vary based on the different types of services offered by DeFi services.</p>,,"AML/CFT,anti money laundering,counter financing of terrorism,DeFi,illicit finance,money laundering",Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on 50 White w/Gloss Lam,62,Y,,,11-Apr-23,11-Apr-23,24.95,20.99,33.99,22.99,37.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,24.95,,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,24.95,30,,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

It contains a then-unique historical table of suicide bombings 1980-2006 as well as many  enduring insights about the strategic ramifications of this despicable weapon of ""war"".</p><p><br></p><p>From the author's abstract:</p><p>This monograph analyzes recent post-1980 suicide bombings and determines the probability of such bombings occurring in the Continental United States CONUS. The analysis includes a brief history of modern suicide bombing an examination of the strategic  tactical  social  and individual logic of suicide bombing a discussion of the probable characteristics of suicide bombings against the United States  both within CONUS and abroad and recommendations about what can be done to mitigate future bombings. Suicide attackers have been a part of warfare for over two millennia  but the coupling of suicide attackers and explosives greatly increased the importance and effectiveness of this tactic in the 20th century. The modern phenomenon of suicide bombing had its genesis in the Iran-Iraq War from 1980-88. Concurrent with the Iran-Iraq War  Iran influenced the development of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Hezbollah tried suicide bombing against the United States and France  and then later against Israel. Other groups such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE  the Palestinians  and the Peoples Liberation Army of Kurdistan PKK started employing suicide bombers in the 1980s and 1990s. As suicide bombing spread geographically and ideologically  it also increased in sophistication. It advanced from being a simple bomb delivered by truck  to include suicide vests  boat bombs  and eventually airplanes. The vast majority of suicide bombings 98 are part of an organized campaign. The only group that conducts suicide bombings against the United States outside of active war zones is Al-Qaida. Al-Qaida attacks have evolved to the point where there are two different strains al-Qaida-sponsored and al-Qaida-inspired. Both are likely to occur in the continental United States within the mid-future. Appendix A lists 2 202 suicide bombings that have occurred since 1980. As of early 2007  this is the best available open source suicide bombing database in the world.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

The report covers a range of issues  including the FBI's use of surveillance orders  the reliability of sources  the handling of the Steele dossier  and the Alfa Bank and Yotaphone allegations.</p><p><br></p><p>The report finds that the FBI made numerous errors and omissions in its handling of the investigation  including failing to follow its own policies and procedures  failing to adequately vet and corroborate information from sources  and failing to disclose important information to the FISA court. The report also criticizes the FBI's handling of the Steele dossier  which it says was relied upon too heavily and without sufficient corroboration. Additionally  the report highlights the Alfa Bank and Yotaphone allegations  which were based on flimsy evidence and were promoted by individuals with ties to the Clinton campaign.</p><p><br></p><p>The report makes a number of recommendations for improving the FBI's handling of counterintelligence investigations  including better vetting of sources  more transparency in FISA applications  and more rigorous oversight of investigations. The report also calls for the FBI to take steps to address bias and improper motivation in its investigations.</p><p>    </p><p>Overall  the report paints a picture of an FBI that was overly reliant on questionable sources and evidence  and that failed to adequately scrutinize the information it was using to justify its surveillance of the Trump campaign. While the report does not find evidence of political bias in the FBI's handling of the investigation  it does highlight a number of serious flaws in the agency's procedures and practices.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Annotations</strong></p><p><br></p><p>AI enhancements include a Foreword by Cincinnatus [AI]; several different Abstracts including tldr(one word); tldr; ELI5; and Action Items; extractive  recursive  and virtual context summaries; mood sketches created using text to image tools; and a Homeric Table of Contents  summarizing each page in a short ode.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>,,"Alfa Bank allegations,applications targeting Page,campaign-funded Steele Reports,Clinton Plan intelligence,Company Intelligence Report,Crossfire Hurricane Investigation,FBI Counterintelligence Investigation,FBI interview report,FBI OGC Unit,FISA applications Page,Inspection Division Report,Mueller Special Counsel,Steele Dossier reporting,Steele Report information,targeting Carter Page,uncorroborated Steele Report",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,358,Y,,,23-May-23,23-May-23,24.99,20.99,33.99,23.99,37.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,24.99,,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,40,,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

Improved processes  tools  and education are required to adapt to mediaverse influencers. The most significant systemic improvement is the addition of a robust strategic feedback loop in the strategy formulation model. This can be accomplished by better integrating information operators into campaign planning and mission execution to surveil the mediaverse to assess content and on-going events to provide a robust assessment of the information environment.

The report emphasizes the importance of these satellite systems for the military and the need for rigorous scrutiny of their design and costs. It also mentions ongoing investigations and cautions against rushing to judgment. The report concludes by urging a focus on the requirements and credibility of these systems. Additionally  the report explores alternatives and methods to preserve the Air Force's options for space-based tactical warning and attack assessment systems. It discusses the role of the Defense Support Program (DSP) as a safety net for the Follow-on Early Warning System (FEWS) and evaluates near-term enhancements to the DSP to provide improved interim capabilities. The report suggests an evolutionary approach to continue the DSP program  employing technology insertion and planned product improvements to control costs and improve performance.

It highlights various elements that are now at the center of discussions on U.S. defense  including grand strategy  force-planning standards  organizational changes within the Department of Defense  nuclear weapons and deterrence  global military posture  military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe  new operational concepts  high-end conventional warfare  maintaining U.S. superiority in conventional weapon technologies  innovation and speed of weapon system development and deployment  mobilization capabilities  supply chain security  and countering hybrid warfare and gray-zone tactics. The document emphasizes that Congress plays a crucial role in determining how U.S. defense planning and budgeting should respond to GPC and whether to approve  reject  or modify the Biden Administration's defense strategy and proposed funding levels. These decisions could have significant implications for U.S. defense capabilities  funding requirements  and the defense industrial base. The document also discusses the concept of Great Power Competition (GPC) and its implications for defense. It highlights the acknowledgment of GPC in the strategies of the Obama  Trump  and Biden administrations. The Biden Administration's National Security Strategy (NSS) identifies two strategic challenges: the end of the post-Cold War era and the competition between major powers  and the shared challenges faced by people worldwide. The NSS emphasizes the increasing risk of conflict between major powers and the challenges posed by China and Russia's behavior. It mentions Russia's immediate threat to the international order and Ukraine  while China seeks to reshape the international order and create a world conducive to its autocracy. The document also emphasizes the need for the United States to modernize and strengthen its military to compete with major powers and address shared challenges.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

In recent years  we have seen a disturbing trend where extreme ideas from the Early Atomic Era were dusted off and brought to reality  like the Russian ""Poseidon"" nuclear-powered  nuclear-armed strategic torpedo and the threatened nuclear EMP anti-satellite weapon.

The analysis reveals a consistent pattern of historical distortion aimed at bolstering the regime's authority and concealing its early failures. Despite internal resistance from military officers  historians  and writers  the fabricated narrative dominated the postwar period. Following Stalin's death  strategic concerns and Khrushchev's revelations prompted a reappraisal  leading to a more candid acknowledgment of initial defeats and the contributions of the Allies. However  recent historiography reflects a cautious balance between acknowledging past mistakes and preserving the party's historical reputation. While politically motivated distortions persist  the increasing volume of military studies and translated foreign works suggests a growing recognition of the value of truth in understanding and preparing for potential future conflicts.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

MTBSTC: Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Center,9781608880997,1608880990,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Jones, Charles B.",,,Author,,,,,,HIS027100,HISTORY / Wars & Conflicts / World War II / General,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,,,Nimble Books LLC,1,,,,,"<p>This book is the first comprehensive history of an important  but mostly overlooked  element of the World War II Patrol Torpedo (PT) boats: the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center (MTBSTC) in Melville  Rhode Island. While not every sailor who served on PT boats went through the training at MTBSTC  every PT sailor was affected by what went on there. The MTBSTC created the PT boats' operational policies and tactics  as well as weapons and equipment experimentation and development. Even the orders the men received for their PT boat assignment were dictated by the MTBSTC. Most of the books written about PT boats have only a passing reference to the MTBSTC. This lack of detailed information on the Training Center has left a large hole in the overall printed history of PT boats. This book fills that gap.</p><p>
This book documents the Training Center from its beginnings when the land was undeveloped swampland  through its growing pains during construction and expansion during the war. It traces the problems of developing a training curriculum from scratch  the struggles to keep the training current  up through the point when the training reached its peak of proficiency just as the war ended. It provides insight into what life was like for the sailors that spent two to three months going through the training program and of those who were stationed at the Training Center as instructors or staff personnel. This book also details the Training Center's post-war career and its current development as a thriving marina and boat building enterprise.</p><p>
This book is culled from the MTBSTC's wartime correspondence files and other deck logs  published and unpublished books  articles  and reports; and interviews with PT boat veterans who underwent the training at the MTBSTC. It is lavishly illustrated with archival  private  and public photographs  most of which have never been published before.</p><p>

This book  delving into the heart of a Cold War crisis and its impact on the National Security Agency  reveals the challenges and triumphs of those tasked with safeguarding national security. It speaks to our innate desire to unravel mysteries  to seek knowledge in the face of danger  and to learn from the past to navigate the uncertain future.&nbsp;By illuminating the complexities of intelligence operations and the consequences of miscalculation  this book offers a timely and compelling insight into the ongoing struggle to protect national interests and the ever-present threat of conflict in a world where knowledge is power.</p><p><br></p><p>On April 15  1969  as North Koreans celebrated the birthday of Kim Il-sung  a U.S. Navy EC-121 reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by a North Korean MIG-21 over the Sea of Japan  tragically killing 31 American crew members. This hostile act  the second in 15 months  shook the U.S. and threw the National Security Agency (NSA) into a crisis management mode  prompting a reevaluation of U.S. intelligence activities. The incident exposed vulnerabilities in the U.S. reconnaissance program and inter-service communication  particularly regarding the Navy's guarded control over its assets.&nbsp;The EC-121  primarily an Elint (electronic intelligence) platform with limited Comint (communications intelligence) capability  was considered by some within NSA to be collecting redundant information  adding to the controversy surrounding the incident.</p><p>The shootdown prompted a flurry of activity at NSA headquarters. A SIGINT alert was declared  and officials scrambled to piece together the events leading up to the tragic incident  determine the exact location of the shootdown to counter North Korea's claims of airspace violation  and assess the intelligence value of such peripheral flights.

This 2010 publication by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides an unparalleled insight into the potential consequences of a high-altitude nuclear detonation on our critical space infrastructure. By unraveling the complex interplay of nuclear weapon effects and the dynamics of the space environment  it offers a stark and timely warning about the potential for catastrophic disruption. This book is not merely an academic exercise; it's a call to action  urging readers to confront the very real threats to our technological lifeline and to advocate for the robust protection of the space-based assets that underpin our modern world.</p><p><br></p><p>This document presents an exhaustive study on the potential collateral damage to satellites from high-altitude nuclear detonations  a scenario of particular concern in the context of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks. It provides a detailed overview of satellite populations  their orbits  and their strategic importance to the United States  both economically and militarily. Drawing upon lessons from atmospheric nuclear tests conducted in the late 1950s and early 1960s  the report highlights the potential for long-lived trapped energetic electrons  injected into Earth's magnetic fields by such detonations  to cause significant damage and premature failure of satellites.</p><p>The document delves into the physical principles behind natural and nuclear weapon-enhanced space environments  focusing on trapped radiation like the Van Allen belts. It meticulously examines the effects of various types of natural and nuclear radiation on satellite electronic components  surface materials  and systems. The authors note  in particular  that previous studies may have underestimated the damaging effects of weapon-induced ultraviolet radiation on surface materials.&nbsp;</p><p>To provide a comprehensive assessment  the report postulates twenty-one trial nuclear events with varying yields and locations as credible terrestrial EMP attacks or other nuclear threats.&nbsp;These events are then analyzed for their impact on representative low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites  the GPS constellation  and a generic GEO satellite.The study concludes that LEO satellites are at substantial risk of exceeding their total dose limits for trapped radiation  especially if standard natural space hardening criteria are applied.However  the authors believe the likelihood of an individual satellite being close enough to a detonation to be directly threatened by prompt radiation effects is relatively low.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

Space-based solar power  long a dream of science fiction  is now within the realm of possibility. The technological innovations described herein  such as advanced solar cells and electric propulsion  have the potential to revolutionize not only our energy infrastructure but also space exploration itself. Investing in SBSP is not merely a pragmatic step toward a cleaner future; it's an investment in our innate human drive to explore  innovate  and transcend limitations.</p><p><br></p><p>This report  prepared for NASA  estimates the costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of two proposed space-based solar power (SBSP) systems  comparing them to terrestrial renewable energy sources. The study considers two designs: the Innovative Heliostat Swarm (RD1) and the Mature Planar Array (RD2)  both operating in geostationary orbit (GEO) and delivering 2 gigawatts of power to Earth.  The study finds that launch and manufacturing costs are the primary drivers for both systems  making them significantly more expensive than terrestrial alternatives. The baseline assessment suggests that SBSP might have lifecycle costs per unit of electricity that are 12-80 times higher than terrestrial options. However  the study also highlights potential cost reductions through technological advancements and operational efficiencies. These include reduced launch costs  improved solar cell efficiency  efficient manufacturing at scale  extended hardware lifetimes  and the use of electric propulsion for orbital transfer.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

These experiences aren't always fun. The medicine tastes bad and the shots hurt.  ""Be brave and know that you are not alone"" is Lexie's message  as she encourages young children who face these same challenges in Brave Just Like Me.<p>By age 8 most children brave getting a shot  taking medicine  an x-ray or two  and quite likely a brief hospitalization or emergency room visit.  Among them are those who courageously face repeated hospitalizations  surgeries  feeding tubes  dialysis  EEGs  respiration and heart monitors  and a life-time of therapy. Lexie has a medical condition that requires her to spend a lot of time in therapy  at hospitals  and in doctors' offices. She knows first-hand just how difficult  painful  and scary  these experiences can be. ""Be brave and know that you are not alone"" is Lexie's message  as she encourages young children who face these challenges in Brave Just Like Me.<p>Brave Just Like Me was inspired by a three year old girl named Lexie  who was born with a life threatening medical condition. One day  shortly after Lexie returned home from her second kidney transplant surgery  her mother held her in her arms while she slept.  It was a day like many others  but as her mother gazed in deepest admiration on her brave little girl  the words to this book were born - not in a slow or uncertain trickle but in strong  overpowering waves. So compelling was this experience  that Lexie's mother laid her sleeping child in bed to capture these words in writing.  Inspired by love and a deep desire to acknowledge  comfort  and encourage children who face the same hardships her daughter experiences  Kimberly wrote her first children's book. <p>It was only a matter of days before this first time author found an illustrator  who not only offered but insisted on painting the illustrations for the book and donating the artwork.  Stacy spent years painting for the book  as her schedule allowed  and through many personal challenges. Through Stacy  Kimberly found Leslie  a graphic design artist who helped finish the illustrations and set words to art  again donating her work to the cause  despite her own personal hardships. The book moved from Stacy  to Leslie  to Aaron  who volunteered to scan the artwork into print ready files. The book then found its way to a publisher  who not only believed enough in the book to publish it  but valued an affordable price point over profit to ensure the book reached those who needed it most.  So  really  Brave Just Like Me has two stories to tell - one about a brave little girl and one about the kindness and goodness of people.  <p>Each person who has touched this book wants only one thing from this endeavor - to comfort and encourage young children who are working courageously to overcome the pain and disabilities that often accompany serious and life threatening medical conditions. ""It is our sincerest hope that Brave Just Like Me finds its way into the hands of these precious children.  We would encourage anyone who purchases this book for a loved one to also consider donating a copy to a local children's hospital  pediatrician  therapist  or Ronald McDonald House.""  Recognizing that these children aren't the only ones who need comforting and encouragement  the author invites the parents of children facing serious and life threatening medical conditions to join the virtual support group she created precisely for this purpose at bravejustlikeme.com.<p>",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,32,,N,,5-Apr-11,17-Feb-11,9.99,7,11,9,11,20,25,20,20,20,No,No,No,No,No,9.99,,9.99,,,,,9.99,9.99,,,,20,,20,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

As nuclear proliferation casts a shadow over global stability  understanding the dynamics of a nuclear-armed regional opponent is no longer a matter of academic curiosity but a vital necessity.  This book equips you with the knowledge to navigate this complex landscape  connecting the lessons of the Cold War to the realities of today's volatile geopolitical chessboard. Driven by the fundamental human need for security  this is a must-read for policymakers  military professionals  and anyone concerned about the future of international peace and security.</p><p><br></p><p>This study  prepared by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for the Office of Net Assessment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense  examines the increasing likelihood that the United States will face nuclear-armed regional adversaries in future conflicts and explores the implications of this likelihood for US strategy  military planning  and force structure.  The report also examines how the history of nuclear proliferation suggests a new period of punctuated equilibria in which the number of states possessing nuclear weapons will increase. The study then analyzes how emerging nuclear powers may seek to take advantage of the apparent brittleness of current US strategic and operational responses to the nuclear threat  which are rooted in the binary choice between inaction and nuclear retaliation. The authors identify three basic strategic and operational responses available to the US: Option A  or the status quo  which relies on overwhelming conventional military superiority coupled to nuclear deterrence; Option B  or a Moderate Adaptation Strategy  in which the United States makes a major investment in counterforce and active/passive defense capabilities to neutralize a regional nuclear threat without recourse to a large-scale nuclear retaliatory response; and Option C  or an Aggressive Adaptation Strategy of Neutralization and Defeat  in which the United States invests in the full range of counterforce  active defense  and C4ISR capabilities to neutralize a regional nuclear threat and to prevail in a protracted regional conflict despite nuclear weapons use by the adversary.  </p><p><br></p><p>After analyzing both the requirements and feasibility of Options B and C  the study concludes with several recommendations to prepare the US for this challenge.These recommendations include developing new concepts of operations  training for counter-nuclear operations  operating from heavily defended bases within the theater of operation  preparing for dispersed combined arms operations  and determining an appropriate EMP tax to ensure that all future combat systems can function in an electronically disturbed environment.  Finally  by preparing for a regional nuclear conflict  US military forces will also obtain a robust capacity to deal with opponents equipped with a large arsenal of precision-guided  tactical and theater range munitions.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

It examines specific regional contexts  including the Middle East  Latin America  and other parts of the Third World  providing insights into the nuances of Soviet and allied support for various actors  such as the PLO in the Middle East and insurgent movements in Latin America. The document also analyzes the role of surrogates like Cuba and East Germany in furthering Soviet aims  highlighting their contributions to training  arming  and providing logistical support to these groups.</p><p><br></p><p>Furthermore  the estimate delves into the dynamics between the Soviet Union and radical states like Libya and Syria  exploring the limits of Soviet influence over their actions  particularly concerning terrorism.

This report provides a glimpse into the meticulous planning and immense resources that the Soviet Union has devoted to supporting its military operations in East Germany.  You will be empowered with insights into the potential for conflict and the strategic capabilities of the Soviet military  giving you a new perspective on the geopolitical landscape and the challenges that lie ahead.  As a concerned citizen  it is essential to understand the potential for conflict and to be informed about the capabilities of the world's major military powers.  This report offers a unique and valuable opportunity to gain a greater understanding of the Soviet military and the role it plays in global affairs.</p><p><br></p><p>This report  prepared by the CIA Directorate of Intelligence in February 1984  examines the Soviet military rear services in East Germany.  It highlights the significant logistic preparations made by the Soviets  including the stockpiling of critical supplies such as ammunition and POL (petroleum  oil  and lubricants)  the development of medical support facilities  and the establishment of maintenance capabilities.  The report concludes that Soviet logistic preparations in East Germany significantly exceed their doctrinal requirements for the forces currently stationed there  suggesting a large reserve for the Western Theater of Military Operations.  The report notes that while these preparations likely make Soviet planners confident of their ability to sustain the initial period of a war  they would still need to mobilize large numbers of support personnel to sustain a prolonged conflict.</p><p><br></p><p>This annotated edition illustrates the capabilities of the AI Lab for Book-Lovers to add context and ease-of-use to manuscripts.

David's Wings: The Strategic Development of the Israeli Air Force provides a compelling blueprint for the evolution of a small state's air force into a potent instrument of national power.  The lessons learned from the IAF's remarkable journey from its humble beginnings to its current status as a global leader in airpower offer invaluable insights for military strategists  policymakers  and anyone interested in the dynamics of modern warfare.  This book illuminates not only the tactical and operational brilliance of the IAF  but also the profound connection between airpower  national security  and the enduring human quest for survival and self-determination.</p><p><br></p><p>The Israeli Air Force (IAF) has evolved from a small  defensive force to a major player in the Middle East.  This thesis explores the IAF's history from its inception in 1947 to the mid 1980s and examines the factors that have influenced its development. The study identifies two distinct periods that act as inflection points in the IAF's development  the tenures of Major General Dan Tolkovski in the 1950s and Major General Benny Peled in the 1970s. </p><p><br></p><p>The thesis also identifies several key factors that have contributed to the IAF's evolution. These include the constant existential threat faced by Israel  the country's small size and lack of strategic depth  the air-mindedness of Israeli leaders  and the IAF's focus on quality and standards. The study also highlights the importance of technology and acquisition in the IAF's development. </p><p><br></p><p>The thesis concludes that the IAF's evolution is a unique case study in air force development. The IAF's success is due to a combination of factors  including the country's unique geopolitical situation  the vision of its leaders  and the dedication and skill of its personnel.

This document  a declassified and previously un-published account of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident of 1964  goes deep inside the National Security Agency's (NSA) signals intelligence (SIGINT) operation during the crisis  revealing a shocking truth:  the second attack  which was used to justify a congressional resolution granting President Johnson a blank check for military intervention in Vietnam  never happened.  </p><p><br></p><p>This report  drawing on an unprecedented amount of newly-released and previously unavailable SIGINT data  and originally published in the NSA's <em>Cryptologic Quarterly </em> analyzes the events that transpired between August 2-4  1964   revealing how analytic errors and deliberate misrepresentations of intercepted communications  ultimately led to a tragic escalation of the conflict.

He's a man of leisure a privileged soul whose time is as plentiful as his coin. But his heart is decidedly stuck in his youth stuck so firmly that the poor chap has decided to embark on an odd and ill-conceived quest to recapture the magic of his teenage years in various locations around England and Europe.</p><p><br></p><p>To say Conrad has a penchant for melodrama is something of an understatement. He's a man of excessive and uncharacteristic melancholy a melancholy  I hasten to add  that he often fails to express with nuance or subtlety. And his romanticism is as much a burden as a blessing  creating a distinct undercurrent of angst and frustration in what should be a rather delightful lark.</p><p><br></p><p>As for the women in his life  they are all interesting in their own way  but they are not particularly well-drawn. They seem to be caught in a bit of a time warp  oscillating between youthful bravado and a rather jaded perspective on life. It's no wonder that Conrad is so eager to find some stability in the chaos!</p><p><br></p><p>All in all   _Conrad in Quest of His Youth_ is a rather charming and engaging novel. It is a light-hearted romp through the world of 19th-century leisure class a world that is often both frivolous and surprisingly poignant.  It's not a perfect novel but it's not without its charms.  It's a good read for anyone who is looking for a light-hearted adventure. And for those who are not easily offended  a few of the author's more audacious digressions may even provide some unexpected laughs. </p><p><br></p>,<p>In a world obsessed with youth  it's easy to feel like the clock is ticking away our chance at genuine happiness and adventure. We yearn for those days when life seemed full of possibility and every experience held a thrilling  unadulterated spark.</p><p><br></p><p>Leonard Merrick's *Conrad in Quest of His Youth* is a 1911 novel that takes us on a witty and insightful journey with Conrad  a man who finds himself yearning for the lost magic of his youthful days in Rouen. He embarks on a nostalgic quest  searching for the places and the people of his past  hoping to recapture the emotions that once made him feel so vibrantly alive.</p><p><br></p><p>Merrick's tale resonates with our present-day preoccupations with youth  as the relentless march of time compels Conrad to question his place in a world that seems to have left him behind. His journey highlights the bittersweet nature of nostalgia and the complex ways in which our perceptions of ourselves and our world can be shaped by memory.</p><p><br></p><p>Conrad's quest  though filled with misadventures and unexpected encounters  ultimately reveals the enduring power of love and the beauty of rediscovering the joys of living in the present moment. *Conrad in Quest of His Youth* is a must-read for anyone who has ever longed for the past  for those who appreciate subtle social satire  and for those who find solace in the poignant realization that joy can be found in unexpected places.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>,<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> (three words): Love  lost  found.</p><p><br></p>,"Chorus girls,Dress rehearsal,Leading parts,Music-hall songs,nostalgia,nostalgia in literature,Provincial town,Stage-door,Theatrical career,Traveling manager,Turkish trousers,Working man",B&W 4 x 6 in or 152 x 102 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Matte Lam,44,Y,,,29-Oct-24,,6.95,5.99,9.99,6.99,10.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,6.95,,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,6.95,40,,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

Cover - Blue""",ENG,,,,0,"Dodd, William",,,Author,,,,,,LCO000000,LITERARY COLLECTIONS / General,DRA010000,DRAMA / Shakespeare,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"William Dodd (29 May 1729 - 27 June 1777) was an English Anglican clergyman and a man of letters. He lived extravagantly  and was nicknamed the ""Macaroni Parson"". He dabbled in forgery in an effort to clear his debts  was caught  convicted  and  despite a public campaign for a Royal pardon  became the last person to be hanged at Tyburn for forgery.  The Beauties of Shakespear was his most successful book and played a key role in reviving Shakespeare's popularity. This is a facsimile edition.<p>

From the author's preface to this collection of ""Greatest Hits"":<p>

I shall not attempt any labored encomiums of  Shakspeare  or endeavor to set forth his perfections  at a time when such universal and just applause is paid him  and when every tongue is big  with his boundless fame. He himself tells us -<p>

To gild refined gold  to paint the lily <br>
 To throw a perfume on the violet <br> 
 To smooth the ice  or add another hue  <br>
Unto the rainbow  or with taper-light<br> 
 To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish  <br>
 Is wasteful and ridiculous excess."" <br>

And wasteful and ridiculous indeed it would be to  say anything in his praise  when presenting the  world with such a collection of Beauties as per-  haps is nowhere to be met with  and  I may very  safely affirm  cannot be paralleled from the produc-  tions of any other single author  ancient or modern.  There is scarcely a topic  common with other writers   on which he has not excelled them all; there are  many nobly peculiar to himself  where he shines  unrivalled  and like the eagle  properest emblem of  his daring genius  soars beyond the common reach  and gazes undazzled on the sun.<p>",,,"B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Blue Digital Cloth!

"No-Fly Zones:Strategic, Operational, and Legal Considerations for Congress",9781608881246,1608881245,Title has expired,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,"Congressional Research Service,",,,Author,,,,,,LAW018000,LAW / Constitutional,HIS026000,HISTORY / Middle East / General,HIS027140,HISTORY / Military / Aviation & Space,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Congressional Research Service Report issued March 18  2011.<p>The ongoing uprising in Libya against the government of Muammar al Qadhafi has been the subject of ongoing domestic and international debate about potential international military intervention  including the proposed establishment of a no-fly zone over Libya. Congress may wish to consider issues surrounding the strategy  international authorization  congressional authorization  operations  and costs of establishing and maintaining no-fly zones. <p>The military strategy designed to support the grand strategy  it has been suggested  might be based on these considerations: the operational-level military objectives that need to be achieved  to support the overall grand strategy; and the extent to which a no-fly zone-as one set of ways and means-helps achieve those objectives. <p>Practitioners and observers have debated what constitutes international ""authorization"" for the establishment of a no-fly zone. Given the paucity of relevant precedents  and the dissimilarities among them  there may not exist a single  clear  agreed model. The concept of authorization is typically considered to be linked to the ideas of both ""legality"" and ""legitimacy""-the three concepts overlap but are all distinct. The precise meaning of each of the terms is still debated. Express authorization from the U.N. Security Council provides the clearest legal basis for imposing a no-fly zone. <p>In addition to international authorization  debates have addressed the question of congressional authorization-whether and when there is a need for congressional approval based on the War Powers Resolution for a proposed no-fly zone. The question of whether and how congressional authorization is sought for a proposed operation could have an impact on congressional support- including policy  funding  and outreach to the American people-for the operation. Since the War Powers Resolution gives the President the authority to launch U.S. military actions prior to receiving an authorization from Congress for 60-90 days  it is possible that the President could direct U.S. Armed Forces to take or support military actions in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions  or in support of NATO operations  and then seek statutory authority for such actions from Congress. <p>No-fly zone operations can conceivably take a number of different forms  and can themselves vary a great deal over time. Key considerations include  but are not limited to  the following factors: the nature  density  quantity  and quality of adversary air assets; geography; the availability of ""friendly"" assets; the adversary's military capabilities and responses; the U.S. military's concept of operations  and the rules of engagement. <p>The costs of establishing and maintaining a no-fly zone are likely to vary widely based on several key parameters. They could be the specific military tasks that a given no-fly zone operation calls for  the geography of the adversary's country  the duration of the no-fly zone  the extent to which the U.S. is joined by international partners in the effort  and the extent of ""mission creep""-how  if at all  the operation expands to include a broader array of activities designed to achieve the same military and strategic objectives. <p>",,,Premium Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,24,,N,,31-Mar-01,22-Apr-11,17.13,11,18,15,18,20,25,20,20,20,No,No,No,No,No,17.13,,17.13,,,,,17.13,17.13,,,,20,,20,,,,,20,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Brave Just Like Me,9781608881215,1608881210,Title has expired,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"By age 8 most children brave getting a shot  taking medicine  an x-ray or two  and quite likely a brief hospitalization or emergency room visit.  Among them are those who courageously face repeated hospitalizations  surgeries  feeding tubes  dialysis  EEGs  respiration and heart monitors  and a life-time of therapy. Lexie has a medical condition that requires her to spend a lot of time in therapy  at hospitals  and in doctors' offices. She knows first-hand just how difficult  painful  and scary  these experiences can be. ""Be brave and know that you are not alone"" is Lexie's message  as she encourages young children who face these challenges in Brave Just Like Me.<p>Brave Just Like Me was inspired by a three year old girl named Lexie  who was born with a life threatening medical condition. One day  shortly after Lexie returned home from her second kidney transplant surgery  her mother held her in her arms while she slept.  It was a day like many others  but as her mother gazed in deepest admiration on her brave little girl  the words to this book were born - not in a slow or uncertain trickle but in strong  overpowering waves. So compelling was this experience  that Lexie's mother laid her sleeping child in bed to capture these words in writing.  Inspired by love and a deep desire to acknowledge  comfort  and encourage children who face the same hardships her daughter experiences  Kimberly wrote her first children's book. <p>It was only a matter of days before this first time author found an illustrator  who not only offered but insisted on painting the illustrations for the book and donating the artwork.  Stacy spent years painting for the book  as her schedule allowed  and through many personal challenges. Through Stacy  Kimberly found Leslie  a graphic design artist who helped finish the illustrations and set words to art  again donating her work to the cause  despite her own personal hardships. The book moved from Stacy  to Leslie  to Aaron  who volunteered to scan the artwork into print ready files. The book then found its way to a publisher  who not only believed enough in the book to publish it  but valued an affordable price point over profit to ensure the book reached those who needed it most.  So  really  Brave Just Like Me has two stories to tell - one about a brave little girl and one about the kindness and goodness of people.  <p>Each person who has touched this book wants only one thing from this endeavor - to comfort and encourage young children who are working courageously to overcome the pain and disabilities that often accompany serious and life threatening medical conditions. ""It is our sincerest hope that Brave Just Like Me finds its way into the hands of these precious children.  We would encourage anyone who purchases this book for a loved one to also consider donating a copy to a local children's hospital  pediatrician  therapist  or Ronald McDonald House.""  Recognizing that these children aren't the only ones who need comforting and encouragement  the author invites the parents of children facing serious and life threatening medical conditions to join the virtual support group she created precisely for this purpose at bravejustlikeme.com.<p>",,,Premium Color 8 x 10 in or 254 x 203 mm Case Laminate on White w/Gloss Lam,36,,,,29-Apr-11,27-Apr-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

Re-reading A GAME OF THRONES: A Critical Response to George R.R. Martin's Fantasy Classic,9781608881154,1608881156,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Verhoeve, Remy J.",,,Author,,,,,,LIT004260,LITERARY CRITICISM / Science Fiction & Fantasy,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"In 1996  George R.R. Martin electrified fantasy fans around the world when he published A Game of Thrones  the first book in his acclaimed A Song of Ice and Fire series. Since then  Martin has published three more books in the series. The engrossing tale Martin spun with these first novels in his saga has gained more and more fans across the world and has resulted in a number of spin-off products  such including HBO's TV series  card and board games  computer games  sword replicas  comic books and calendars. Perhaps paradoxically  the number of years between each time Martin publishes a new book in the series has increased. Fans have been clamoring for the fifth volume  A Dance with Dragons  since 2005: A book that promises to pick up the storylines of fan-favorite characters left hanging since 1999. As Martin struggles to reach the finish line  or indeed even the halfway point in his epic  his fans wait for the next fix. One way to keep sane during the long waits is to re-read the already published novels.<p>

Journey to Westeros with Remy J. Verhoeve as he celebrates his tenth reading of A Game of Thrones. Chapter by chapter  the author  a Dutch-Norwegian English teacher and self-confessed fantasy geek  is both fellow traveler and tour guide as he shares his insightful reflections on Martin's writing techniques  major - and seemingly minor - plot points and characters  and much more.<p>

True to its origins as a blogging project undertaken while not-so-patiently waiting for A Dance With Dragons  the author does not hold back in this unauthorized companion book that is both an unabashed homage to the novel that started it all  as well as a candid - and at times controversial - commentary on the issues surrounding the delayed release of the fifth book.<p>  
Whether or not they agree with everything the author has to say  all fans of A Song of Ice and Fire  from those who have loved the series since its inception in 1996 to those who have only just discovered it through the HBO series  will enjoy this thought-provoking and outspoken book.<p>",,,B&W 5.5 x 8.5 in or 216 x 140 mm (Demy 8vo) Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,372,,N,,17-Apr-11,25-Apr-11,25.99,19.99,31.99,22.99,33.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,25.99,,23.55,25.99,25.99,25.99,23.55,23.55,25.99,25.99,25.99,25.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Bruce Brant examined the **1973 Arab-Israeli War** to draw lessons for NATO's Cold War strategy. Brant's study focused on *battlefield air interdiction (BAI)* - using airpower to strike enemy forces and logistics behind the front lines - and contrasted it with close air support at the frontline. The thesis argued that Israel's experience proved the value of deep  operational-level strikes. In a high-threat environment saturated with surface-to-air missiles (SAMs)  traditional **close air support** was costly  whereas interdiction of second-echelon forces was ""less costly and more effective"" for the defense[^1]. Brant warned that **combat aircraft were no longer supreme** if faced with a sophisticated air defense umbrella[^2] - a sober assessment that anticipated challenges NATO pilots might face against Warsaw Pact SAM networks.</em></p><p></p><p><em>From a high-level policy perspective  Brant's 1986 thesis was **prescient and practically relevant**. Its recommendations - prioritize deep strike over close support  invest in SEAD and surveillance  adapt continuously - have shaped doctrine from Desert Storm to Ukraine.

Some assert that air superiority has become a relic of the past  a casualty of the proliferation of anti aircraft missiles  advanced electronic countermeasures  and sophisticated ground based defenses. Others argue that airpower remains essential to military success  especially in the modern battlefield. And yet  despite the heated rhetoric  few examples of the effective use of airpower in a challenging air defense environment have been available for analysis.  </p><p> </p><p> This crucial 1986 thesis  ""Battlefield Air Interdiction in the 1973 Middle East War and Its Significance to NATO Air Operations "" provides a unique and thorough examination of the use of battlefield air interdiction (BAI) during a conflict of high strategic importance.  The document meticulously examines the 1973 Middle East War  a key historical turning point that saw the introduction of new technology and tactics. Major Brant draws on a wide range of sources  including firsthand accounts  classified reports  and insightful analyses of combat data. His comprehensive analysis of the Israeli Air Force's (IAF) use of BAI during the 1973 War sheds new light on the effectiveness of BAI as a method of targeting the enemy's forces  logistical networks  and supplies before they can be brought to bear on the battlefield.  The author then deftly connects his findings to the NATO environment  providing a valuable comparative analysis of the key similarities and differences between the Middle East theater and Central Europe. He meticulously accounts for terrain  human habitation  weather  distance  and the evolution of tactics  offering a detailed understanding of the complexities that airpower must contend with in a NATO scenario. </p><p> </p><p> Brant also examines the technological developments that have emerged since 1973  including the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles  stand off weapons  and the rise of airborne early warning and control systems.  This thesis  a must read for researchers  military professionals  and policymakers  offers a fresh and invaluable perspective on the critical role of airpower in future conflicts. </p><p> </p><p> Brant's thorough analysis of the 1973 Middle East War  bolstered by detailed combat data and a deep understanding of the evolving technologies and tactics  provides a unique and timely contribution to the discourse.

The 1985 CIA National Intelligence Estimate on Soviet science offers a window into a scientific system grappling with bureaucratic rigidity  resource constraints  and political pressures-challenges that resonate with current debates over US research funding and policy direction. By examining the Soviet experience  we can uncover parallels to modern issues  such as the risks of prioritizing short-term applications over fundamental research or the impact of political instability on scientific progress. This historical perspective provides critical lessons for safeguarding US science against systemic decline  highlighting the need for adaptability and foresight to prevent a similar erosion of scientific vitality.</p>,,"1985 National Intelligence Estimate,Chernobyl impact on science,CIA intelligence Soviet technology,future of Soviet science,Gorbachev science policy,Soviet Academy of Sciences,Soviet science CIA analysis,Soviet scientific decline,Soviet Union collapse science,US science funding crisis",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,48,Y,,,22-Apr-25,22-Apr-25,17.99,13.99,24.99,15.99,28.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,No,No,No,No,17.99,,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,17.99,40,,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

An excerpt:

Here  then  was the ideal type for which Lord Fisher in our conversations had so often sighed; and I was secretly disappointed when  on my mentioning Fisher's name  Beatty merely smiled. And I was still more crestfallen when  a few days later  I spoke of Beatty enthusiastically to Lord Fisher  he gave me a blank  sour look and said: ""Really? Never met him.""

I did not know the Navy as well in those days as I know it now  or I would have been less surprised than I was that the obviously ablest men in control of naval affairs were far from seeing eye to eye with one another  and even (what was more remarkable) neglected to make any real study of one another's aims and potentialities. Naval thought  where it existed  was divided into camps  each one regarding victory over the others as essential to victory over the Germans. Thus Lord Charles Beresford  whose best work in his retirement was his untiring public advocacy of naval efficiency  gave one in private a most alarming impression that the Navy was already practically in German control; and one of his mildest views of Lord Fisher was that he was a madman who  on the eve of war  had deliberately scrapped the majority of our cruisers. Winston Churchill was at one time probably one of the men most disliked by the Navy at large; but when one tried to discuss his administration seriously  one was told stories of his bad manners: as  for example  of his going on board a ship  entering the wardroom  ringing the bell and sending for the Commander - a solecism the gravity of which one must have lived in a wardroom to appreciate. And yet  one felt  it was not quite an argument against his efficiency as an administrator. But all the naval officer saw was a man to whose power our sacred naval traditions were committed  and who apparently knew or cared so little for the smallest of them that the greatest might well be in peril at his hands. The anti-Churchill camp was a very strong one. He  on the other hand  seemed to regard Lord Fisher as a dangerous genius to be caught  chained  tamed  and made careful use of; Lord Fisher regarded him (I am speaking of the two years before the war) as a politician to be fought or flattered  made or destroyed  according to his degree of adaptability to the great purpose.",,,B&W 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,382,,N,,31-May-11,13-Jun-11,31.99,23.99,38.99,27.99,41.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,31.99,,28.68,31.99,31.99,31.99,28.68,28.68,31.99,31.99,31.99,31.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

At 12:05 EST (21:05 Cambodia)  a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) was convened to discuss the situation.  The members of the NSC were determined to end the crisis decisively  believing that the fall of South Vietnam less than two weeks before and the forced withdrawal of the United States from Cambodia  (Operation Eagle Pull) and South Vietnam (Operation Frequent Wind) had severely damaged the U.S.'s reputation.

From the preface to the first volume  Memories:<p>


Readers of this book will quickly observe that Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher has small faith in the printed word; and those who have enjoyed the privilege of having "" his fist shaken in their faces"" will readily admit that the printed word  though faithfully taken down from his dictation  must lack a large measure of the power-the "" aroma "" as he calls it-which his personality lends to his spoken word.<p>

Had Lord Fisher been allowed his own way  there would have been no Book. Not for the first time in his career  the need of serving his country and his country's Navy has over-ridden his personal feeling. These ""Memories "" therefore  must be regarded as a compromise (""the beastliest word in the English language""-see ""The Times"" of September gth  1919) between the No-Book of Lord Fisher's inclination and the orderly  complete Autobiography which the public wishes to possess.<p>

The book consists in the main of the author's ipsissima verba  dictated during the month of September  1919. One or two chapters have been put together from fugitive writings which Lord Fisher had collected and printed (in noble and eloquently various type) as a gift to his friends after his death. The discreeter passages of the letters which he wrote to Lord Esher between 1903 and 1912 illustrate some portions of the life's work which-caring little for the past and much for the future  much for the idea and little for the fact-Lord Fisher has successfully declined to describe in his own words.<p>",,,B&W 6 x 9 in or 229 x 152 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,662,,N,,31-May-11,13-Jun-11,42.99,32.99,53.99,38.99,56.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,42.99,,39,42.99,42.99,42.99,39,39,42.99,42.99,42.99,42.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

Yukichi Fukuzawa (1835-1901) is arguably the greatest Japanese social thinker of the last three centuries  yet he is little known outside his native country  except to experts on Japan. Contemporaries  on the other hand  recognized his eminence and influence.<p>

The dialogue with Fukuzawa has a somewhat different purpose from that with earlier thinkers of the western Enlightenment treated in my previous work. The work of Montesquieu  Smith and Tocqueville  when combined  set out a set of conjectures as to how mankind could and perhaps did 'escape' from the normal tendencies of agrarian civilization. Since Fukuzawa (1835-1901) was writing later  and at a great distance from the original 'escape'  it is unlikely that he will be able to contribute much that is original to the analysis of this problem. For that we have already considered Maitland's impressive solution. On the other hand  Fukuzawa provides an interesting test case for the utility of their theories.<p>

If their model is plausible and seems to have explanatory power  it should be attractive to a thinker whose aim  as we shall see  is to grasp the essence of the first transition from agrarian to industrial civilization so that he can help his own Japanese civilization achieve a similar break-through. If he selects and approves the same central essence as Montesquieu  Smith  Tocqueville and Maitland  their insights would appear to have cross-cultural validity.<p>

An even more stringent test is the degree of success in the material world. In other words  did the recipe work? If an outsider to Europe not only repeated the central theories of those who addressed the riddle of the origins of the modern world  but then applied these to a distant civilization and helped to effect a similar 'escape' in entirely different circumstances  this would be as good a confirmation of the validity of the theory as one could hope for.<p>

The task is made more worthwhile because  despite his eminence and interest  there has only been one book about him in English  and that was also about other thinkers in the Japanese Enlightenment. There have been one or two articles also  but there is no recent intellectual biography of a man who had an enormous impact on Japanese civilization and whose ideas are such a wonderful mirror of western thought and colonial expansion. <p>",,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,98,,N,,30-Jun-11,13-Jun-11,24.99,18.99,30.99,22.99,32.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,24.99,,22.84,24.99,24.99,24.99,22.84,22.84,24.99,24.99,24.99,24.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

<p><i>Advanced Propulsion: Fast vs. Safe</i> plunges into the cutting-edge physics and engineering behind humanity's quest for faster  more efficient space travel. From the proven  high-performance capabilities of Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) - offering nearly double the efficiency of chemical rockets - to the ultra-efficient  high-specific-impulse Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) and diverse electric propulsion systems like ion  Hall  and VASIMR thrusters  this book meticulously details the technologies poised to redefine deep space missions. Discover how these bimodal systems could offer unparalleled versatility  pushing the boundaries of what's possible in propulsion physics.</p>

<p>Yet  speed comes at a price. This essential guide confronts the immense challenges inherent in advanced spaceflight  including the critical radiation risks  the astronomical development costs (measured in billions)  and the political and logistical hurdles of securing long-term funding for projects like fusion and antimatter drives. It delves into the profound ethical and societal questions posed by interstellar travel  where missions may last generations  challenging our very definition of a human society. This book provides a frank assessment of the practical realities  from exotic fuel sourcing to the vast supporting infrastructure required.</p>

<p>Authored by the AI Lab for Book-Lovers and published by Nimble Books LLC  this book uniquely bridges the gap between scientific ambition and the imaginative leaps of science fiction. It explores how concepts popularized in works like <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>The Expanse</i> inspire real-world innovation  while soberly distinguishing between scientific fact and ""handwavium."" It's an indispensable resource for anyone fascinated by the future of space exploration  offering unparalleled insight into both the ""fast"" and ""safe"" sides of the propulsion debate.</p>

<p>Are you ready to venture beyond our solar system? Uncover the true potential and the daunting obstacles that stand between us and the stars. Whether you're an aerospace enthusiast  a student of physics  or simply curious about humanity's next giant leap  <i>Advanced Propulsion: Fast vs. Safe</i> is your definitive guide to the technologies that will take us there.</p></p>",How do we bridge deep space without sacrificing safety?

He was the son of a clergyman and one of eight children. He was educated at Jesus College  Cambridge and later became Professor of History and Political Economy at the East India Company's College at Haileybury in Hertfordshire. His most famous work  the Essay on the Principles of Population  was published in 1798 when he was 32. It has been seen partly as a reaction to the Utopian thought of William Godwin and others  as well as that of Malthus' own father. It is as an extension and formalization of the ideas of the classical economist Adam Smith and others who had laid down some of the basic ideas concerning the tendency of population to outstrip resources.


Malthus' theory in brief was that humankind is permanently trapped by the intersection of two 'laws'. The first concerned the rate at which populations can grow. He took the 'passion between the sexes' to be constant and investigations showed that under conditions of 'natural' fertility (with early marriage and no contraception  abortion or infanticide)  this would lead to an average of about fifteen livebirths per woman. This figure is confirmed by modern demography. Given normal mortality at the time  and taking a less than maximum fertility  this will lead to what Malthus called geometrical growth  namely 1 2 4 8 16. It only needs 32 doublings like this to lead from an original couple to the present world population of over six billion persons. The second premise was that food and other resource production will grow much more slowly. It might double for a generation or two  but could not keep on doubling within an agrarian economy. Thus there could  in the long run  only be an arithmetic or linear growth of the order of 1 2 3 4. Incorporated in this later theory was the law of diminishing marginal returns on the further input of resources  especially labour. Underpinning the scheme was the assumption that there was a finite amount of energy available for humans through the conversion of the sun's energy by living plants and animals. The conclusion was that humankind was trapped  a particular application in the field of demography of the more general pessimism of Adam Smith. Populations would grow rapidly for a few generations  and then be savagely cut back. A crisis would occur  manifesting itself in one (or a combination) of what he called the three 'positive' checks acting on the death rate  war  famine and disease.",,,B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Gloss Lam,140,,N,,30-Jun-11,1-Jul-11,26.99,20.99,33.99,24.99,36.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,26.99,,24.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,24.99,24.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

A Dictionary of Deception: The Tools  That You Need  to Overcome the Semantactical Games Played by Exploitative Elites,9781608881055,1608881059,Title has expired,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"This dictionary takes a satiric look at the ways elites use language to frame and over time  distort our sense of public reality. They use the rhetoric of democracy to thwart the majority will.  An introduction sets the historical context since World War II.<p>What's harder to state are the precise means by which elites consis-tently obtain the public policy outcomes they prefer. We the electorate find ourselves complicit in public policy decisions whose deeper intent  had we been able to discern it  we might have opposed. Elites are skilled in reducing the nation's essential public business to schmoozal and pro-moting the mellow hokus operandi that sustains it.<p>The neologisms and re-defined stock phrases introduced here will help the citizen defend himself from the incessant semantic indirections that the top-up crowd relies on. While the author admits to a certain shameless admiration for bottom-feeding puns  the angel of his better nature strives for more elevated forms of wordplay. The reader should bear in mind that these words-neo  nasty or not-do far less public harm than the gush of self-referential pieties that elites endlessly promote. Were the top-up crowd ever to opt for the semantic directness found here  a new day would be upon us. Why  we might even become the nation we are told we already are!<p>I recall a phrase of Lewis Lapham  retired editor of Harper's Magazine. He wrote once of ""the ritual fictions of a sham democracy.""  That  as this writer interprets his phrase  is what this crotchety  just short of acerbic  but never strident  dictionary is about. Nor will it be found wanting in scholarship. The author sees his work as a merry intrusion into the collective false consciousness our political culture works hard to reward.<p> This format was made famous by Mark Twain's contemporary  Ambrose Bierce  in his Devil's Dictionary  first published under that title one hundred years ago  in 1911.

Frederick",Author,Translator,Editor,,,,LIT004150,LITERARY CRITICISM / European / French,HIS013000,HISTORY / Europe / France,REF019000,REFERENCE / Quotations,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"Living in today's multi-speed world is so exasperatingly in-tense for so many people that a great majority of them find solace in routine and automatism. The cliché has become not only a conscious strategy to conform  but a response to anxiety and despair. Humans are therefore increasingly losing their individual voice and adopting ready-made  stale  worn-out and often inaccurate clichés that trivialize noble ideas and the power of one. In fact  with the advent of ""smart"" technology  free speech  memory and intelligence are becoming endangered species. Ironically  the last several decades of ""contact"" and social networking have nurtured the sport of cliché ping-ponging. It is in such circumstances that I have translated Gustave Flaubert's Dictionnaire des idées reçues  a brilliant questioning of conventional wisdom and a subtle representation of the transformation of Man by the machinery of capitalism.<p>

Since Dictionnaire des idées recues is a microcosm of Flaubert's world  its translation was anything but simple. The task was not only to jump from cliché to cliché while carrying the color and context of the original text  but to contemporize it so that the historical narrative fits into a more modern context. The first dilemma was to decide whether the definitions should be translated identically throughout  or whether a factually different equivalent should be chosen. Such was the case of fungi/fungus as the translation of the French shakos/chacal. Another rather constant difficulty was whether to say ""you"" or ""one"" for the French pronoun ""on""  the indefinite subject par excellence. Finally  I have given myself the freedom to use quotation marks in order to stress a word within the pre-constructed thought.<p>
May this new interpretation serve as an introduction to Flaubert's work and entice new readers to want to learn more. And may those who already know the author believe that I have done all that I could.<p>",,,B&W 5 x 8 in or 203 x 127 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,118,,N,,31-Aug-11,15-Aug-11,26.99,20.99,33.99,24.99,36.99,40,40,40,40,40,No,No,No,No,No,26.99,,24.95,26.99,26.99,26.99,24.95,24.95,26.99,26.99,26.99,26.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

In order to trace the evolving influences behind this warship building program  this thesis divides the pre-war period into three separate phases: Phase 1 is bounded by Roosevelt's inauguration and the USS Panay incident  phase two runs from the USS Panay incident until the fall of France  and phase three covers from the fall of France until the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The German Sixth Army consisted of over 300 000 men when it approached Stalingrad in August 1942. On 2 February 1943  91 000 remained; only some 5 000 survived Soviet captivity. Largely due to the success of previous aerial resupply operations  Luftwaffe leaders assured Hitler they could successfully supply the Sixth Army after it was trapped. However  the Luftwaffe was not up to the challenge. The primary reason was the weather  but organizational and structural flaws  as well as enemy actions  also contributed to their failure. This thesis will address why the Demyansk and Kholm airlifts convinced the Germans that airlift was a panacea for encircled forces; the lessons learned from these airlifts and how they were applied at Stalingrad; why Hitler ordered the Stalingrad airlift despite the logistical impossibility; and seek out lessons for todayxs military.

Specifically  this study seeks to answer the question  ""What is the nature of spacepower?"" It also test the aerospace integration school's hypothesis that spacepower is simply a continuation or extension of airpower. Two points come immediately to the forefront of this work. First  spacepower is different from airpower even though both share the vertical dimension of warfare.  Second  space operations have matured to a point where valid and unique propositions regarding spacepower are identifiable. The ten propositions presented here do not represent a complete list. The method used to derive these propositions involved literary research that result in a long list. The list evolved over three years during numerous brainstorming with several space experts--most of them space weapons officers with theater and often combat experience--until the list was carefully refined into the ten most salient propositions. There were many ways to present the Ten Propositions Regarding Spacepower  but the author deferred to Meininger's approach of citing each proposition as a thesis statement with supporting material immediately following. The objective of this work is to stimulate discussions and help those who do not yet understand or appreciate the nature of spacepower in modern warfare.",,"Space power,space warfare",B&W 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Matte Lam,156,,N,,24-Aug-11,26-Aug-11,22.99,16.99,28.99,20.99,30.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,22.99,,21.36,22.99,22.99,22.99,21.36,21.36,22.99,22.99,22.99,22.99,30,,20,30,30,30,20,20,30,30,30,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.

The doctrinal underpinnings of air power thought are  of course  traditionally ascribed to the three great theorists of air power application  Douhet  Trenchard  and Mitchell. Since the Second World War  the air power community has not often explored the doctrinal implications of air power development. Lord Tedder's Lee Knowles lectures at Cambridge  and the writings of Air Vice Marshal R. A. Mason  and Colonel John A. Warden I11 constitute notable-and noteworthy-exceptions. Now comes Colonel Phillip Meilinger  who has posited a group of provocative propositions that will instill an apprecia-tion for air power for those who seek to understand it and challenge the assumptions of those who do not yet appreciate what it offers. This book has been deliberately designed in a small format so that it can be readily carried in the pocket of a flight suit or a BDU.  <p>

The single most important book that you can read about air strategy.--Ed. <p>

Rising Storm: Battle of the Atlantic 1939-1940 (Naval Wargaming Rules),9781608881031,1608881032,Title has expired,Perfect Bound,ENG,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,From the introduction to these naval wargaming rules:<p>Immediately on the declaration of hostilities in September 1939 the British Admiralty was ready to convoy merchant shipping. They had learnt a lot during 1917-18 and the movement of ships by convoy was something used in war over past centuries. Pre-War it was part of the examination for merchant ship officers and masters  that they learnt the Allied Convoy Orders system with its specific flag and other signals  forming up into columns and the other responsibilities of ships in convoy. Having foreign shipping in a convoy had been planned and the entire convoy system and its signals were kept simple. It was just as well because the Atlantic would be the longest fought battle  lasting from the first to the last day of WW2.<p>     Instructions on convoying merchant ships were already in the secret orders kept in the safe of all warships and commencement of the system went quite smoothly. Perhaps the only difficulties were that it had seldom been rehearsed and with so much done in theory  warships had very little practice at depth charge attacks.<p>      Atlantic convoys met with a close escort at a MOMP (Mid Ocean Meeting Point) if inbound  or if outbound were escorted to it.  Only Battleships  AMC's and cruisers accompanied the convoys in the central Atlantic. On the western side of the Atlantic escorts operating out of Canada met them. But the central Atlantic was vulnerable. Coastal Command aircraft could not reach out that far  and few escorts had sufficient 'legs' to stay with a convoy the whole distance.<p>     Fortunately for the British the German submarine force was still lacking numbers. This was especially so of the larger long-range boats. Later the possession of French Atlantic ports allowed the U Boats available to spend more time at sea and the U Boats were finally able to start limited Wolf Pack tactics. But initially U Boats had to travel to patrol areas from Germany and they were few in number.<p>,,,Premium Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Perfect Bound on White w/Matte Lam,82,,,,1-Sep-11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,6024045,W.

Why the USS Scorpion (SSN 589) Was Lost: The Death of a Submarine in the North Atlantic,9781608881208,1608881202,Available for Printing/Download,Case Laminate,ENG,,,,0,"Rule, Bruce","Livingston, Erich A.",,Author,Prologue by,,,,,TRA006000,TRANSPORTATION / Ships & Shipbuilding / General,HIS027150,HISTORY / Military / Naval,,,Nimble Books LLC,,,,,,"In their official report of 29 January 1970  the SCORPION Structural Analysis Group (SAG)  which included the Navy's leading experts in submarine design  submarine structures  and the effect of underwater explosions  advised the Navy Court of Inquiry (COI) that the US nuclear submarine SCORPION was lost on 22 May 1968 becase of the violent explosion of the main storage battery.<p>

The COI disregarded that assessment and concluded SCORPION was lost because of the ""explosion of (a) large charge weight externalto the submarine's pressure hull.""  That erroneous conclusion which  by default  has become the Navy's explanation for the tragedy  contributed to the conspiracy theory that SCORPION was sunk by a Soviet torpedo.<p>

This book includes six letters sent to the Navy from 2009 to 2011.  These letters provide the results of the first reanalysis in 40 yeears of acoustic detections of the loss of SCORPION.  This reanalysis confirms the 1970 SAG battery-explosion assessment and provides important new information on the loss of SCORPION.<p>

The author was the lead acoustic analyst at the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) for 42 years  ending in 2007.  ONI did not receive any SCORPION acoustic data until the author provided it in October 2009.<p>

The book includes a prologue signed by 96 members of the Scorpion families asking the Navy to bring forth further information on the causes of the tragedy.<p>",,,Premium Color 8.5 x 11 in or 280 x 216 mm Case Laminate on White w/Matte Lam,74,,N,,31-Oct-11,1-Nov-11,34.95,23.99,40.99,28.99,42.99,40,40,40,40,40,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,Yes-Destroy,34.95,,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,34.95,40,,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,40,,,,,,,,,,,Y,6024045,W.
