**Twenty Years of Algorithmic Publishing: What I've Learned**

In 2001, I was working with LexisNexis data when I realized search results were fundamentally broken. We were delivering "answer sets"â€”raw lists of documents users had to manually synthesize. What if we could generate coherent *reports* instead?

Everyone said it was impossible. The technology didn't exist. Usage licenses weren't designed for it. Customers didn't even know to ask for it.

**So I decided to build it myself.**

2006: Founded Nimble Books to experiment with book formatsâ€”unconventional pagination, new annotation systems, format as a variable to optimize.

2010s: Taught myself to program and built PageKickerâ€”a platform that could generate complete books from a single command line. Algorithmic assembly at scale.

2019-2020: When OpenAI released GPT-2 and GPT-3, I immediately wrote a prospectus envisioning human-AI collaboration in book creation. Since 2021, I've been publishing AI-assisted books under "AI Lab for Book-Lovers"â€”testing these ideas in practice.

**Today, I'm working on:**
â†’ Synthetic readers optimizing books through evolutionary algorithms
â†’ Agentic books that update themselves and adapt to readers
â†’ Community-driven books emerging from Discord and Reddit conversations
â†’ Understanding what authenticity means to kids who grew up with AI

**The through-line:** Information should be synthesized into coherent artifacts, not delivered as raw search results. The answer set was never the answer.

**Three lessons from 20 years of experimentation:**

1. **Constraints are temporary.** The technical barriers that seemed insurmountable in 2001 (no text generation) and 2020 (token limits) have fallen. Bet on capability expansion, not current limitations.

2. **Human-AI collaboration is more nuanced than you think.** AI doesn't just executeâ€”it surprises, suggests, and occasionally outperforms. The partnership is creative, not mechanical.

3. **The real test is young readers.** Kids who grew up with AI aren't impressed by synthesis alone. They demand genuine value, not just algorithmic convenience.

We're at an inflection point. Will we use AI to create genuine value for readers, or just manufacture content at scale?

After 20 years, I still believe we can do better. The tools finally exist to prove it.

In 2001, I tried to convince LexisNexis to stop delivering "answer sets" (raw search results) and start generating coherent reports.

They said it was impossible.

20 years later, I've built it myself. Here's what I learned about algorithmic publishing: ðŸ§µ

The problem in 2001: search results were just document dumps. You'd get 500 articles and have to piece together the story yourself.

The solution seemed obvious: synthesize information into actual reports.

The obstacle: no generative AI existed. Only assembly and extraction.

2006: I launched Nimble Books to experiment with book formats.

Different page lengths. New annotation systems. Hybrid structures.

Each book was a test: What happens when you treat format as a variable to optimize, not a convention to inherit?

Then I taught myself to program and built PageKickerâ€”a bash-based platform that could generate entire books from command line:

`bin/builder.sh --seedsviacli "topic1; topic2" --booktitle "My Book"`

One command. Complete book. Algorithmic assembly at scale.

**TWEET 5**
But PageKicker couldn't *generate* textâ€”only assemble what already existed.

That changed in 2019-2020 when OpenAI released GPT-2 and GPT-3.

I wrote a prospectus envisioning authors collaborating with AI "Muses" on book creation.

Finally, real synthesis was possible.

[NOTE TO AUTHOR: Add specific example]

The partnership is more nuanced than I expected. AI doesn't just executeâ€”it surprises you. Suggests things you'd never consider.

That last one is critical. 9-year-olds now say "That's AI!" dismissively when they spot generated content.

They grew up with synthesis everywhere. They're critics, not customers.

If we can't win them over, algorithmic publishing has no future.

The through-line from 2001 to 2025:

Information should be synthesized into coherent artifacts, not delivered as raw search results.

The answer set was never the answer. It was a limitation to transcend.

**From Search Results to AI Books: A 20-Year Journey**

I want to tell you about an idea I had in 2001 that everyone thought was crazyâ€”and how it finally came true.

I was working with LexisNexis data (the big legal/news database) and noticed something frustrating: when you searched for information, you got back this massive list of documentsâ€”what they called an "answer set." Just hundreds of articles dumped on your screen. YOU had to figure out how they fit together, what the story was, what mattered.

I thought: why can't we generate a *report* instead? Something formatted like an e-book that actually synthesizes the information into a coherent narrative?

Everyone said it was impossible. The technology didn't exist. The licenses weren't set up for it. Customers didn't even know to ask for it.

**So I decided to build it myself.**

In 2006, I started Nimble Books and began experimenting with different book formatsâ€”different page lengths, new ways of doing annotations, hybrid structures. Each book was basically a hypothesis about what books could be when you weren't stuck with traditional publishing conventions.

Then I taught myself to program (!!!) and built something called PageKickerâ€”a platform that could create entire books from a single command line. You'd give it some keywords, and it would search Wikipedia, pull relevant content, assemble it into a coherent book, format everything, and output a complete publication.

One command. Complete book. Pretty wild for the 2010s.

But here's the thing: PageKicker could only *assemble* content that already existed. It couldn't actually *generate* new text. We were still limited to rearranging existing pieces.

**Then 2019-2020 happened.**

OpenAI released GPT-2 and GPT-3, and suddenly actual text generation became possible. I immediately wrote this whole prospectus about how authors could work with AI "Muses"â€”collaborating on outlines, generating sections together, learning from each other's preferences.

Since 2021, I've been publishing books under "AI Lab for Book-Lovers" where humans and AI genuinely collaborate. And let me tell youâ€”the AI partnership is way more interesting than I expected. It doesn't just execute commands. It surprises you. It suggests metaphors you'd never think of. Sometimes it writes better than you do.

**What I'm working on now is even wilder:**

- "Synthetic readers"â€”thousands of AI readers testing different versions of books to figure out what actually works best (not just clickbait, but genuine satisfaction)

- "Agentic books" that can answer questions about themselves, update with new information, adapt to what readers need

- Books that emerge from Discord servers or Reddit threadsâ€”where community conversations turn into collaborative narratives

- And this is the big one: figuring out what matters to kids who grew up with AI everywhere

Because here's what I'm seeing: 9-year-olds now look at AI-generated content and say "That's AI!" dismissively. 10-year-olds get annoyed when you try to explain things using ChatGPT.

These kids aren't impressed by synthesis alone. They've seen it their whole lives. They're CRITICS. They can spot the difference between genuine value and algorithmic convenience.

If we can't win them over, algorithmic publishing has no future.

**The big question after 20 years:**

Will we use AI to create genuine value for readers, or just manufacture content at scale? Will we spam the world with words, or actually make books that matter?

I've spent two decades believing we can do better. The tools finally exist to prove it.

Still experimenting. Still learning. Still believing it's possible.

What do you think? Are you optimistic about where AI and books are headed? Concerned? Have your own experiments going? I'd love to hear your thoughts. ðŸ’­
