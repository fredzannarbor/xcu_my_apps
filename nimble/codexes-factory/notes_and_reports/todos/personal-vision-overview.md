# Personal Vision Overview: Nexis to Longform to Today

## Branch: personal-vision-overview

## Overview
A short personal overview of my algorithmic publishing vision from Nexis to longform to today.

## Tasks

- [ ] first draft of Substack style article
- [ ] close editorial reading by model
- [ ] final draft in Substack pastable format
- [ ] threaded version for Threads
- [ ] versions to fit LinkedIn, Twitter long format, Threads long format, Facebook


## Notes

paragraph 1: struck by the idea of producing a report from Nexis data rather than an answer set. 
Lexis Nexis - a flat answer set of Nexis docs is somewhat underwhelming
- why not a report formatted like an e-book? at this time (2001) ebook readers with bespoke formats like LIT were the norm; Kindle was still years away
obstacles:
- company focused on high-value business users rather than discovery users
- customers didn't know they wanted alternative to the answer set
- 20 years later, the answer set is a mirror maze of advertisements
- Nexis usage licenses assumed answer set use case, not inside fixed electronic product
- no generative text capability at this point, document creation limited to assembly, hierarchy, fact and term extraction

paragraph 2: I launched Nimble Books in 2006 and promptly began experimenting with formats: differing page lengths, annotation, etc.  review titles at https://amzn.to/46XJMjD and summarize experiments

paragraph 3: PageKicker startup, taught myself to program, built evrything in bash.
review  https://github.com/fredzannarbor/pagekicker-community/ and summarize functionality and innovations/;  Simon Dudley correctly understood PageKicker represented an evolution away from the answer set (Web search for article he wrote about PageKicker)

Paragraph 4: OpenAI releases GPT2 in Dec 2020, transforming text generation possibilities; I write longform prospectus.  See @docs/resources/longform_prospectus.md.  Compare my assessment then with progress to date.  Discuss my experiments published under heading of AI Lab for Book-Lovers, 2021 - date; Amazon: https://amzn.to/42dydSQ.

Paragraph 5: my vision has expanded and is continuing to do so 
-- armies of synthetic readers iterating thousands of variations homing in on most satisfying titles
-- agentic books (cf. recent Arxiv paper on agentic research papers)
-- popup chatbot microcommunities => books
-- focus on young readers, alternative format, what engages them 
   -- 9 yo disparages: "That's AI!"
   -- 10 yo - don't parentsplain with ChatGPT
