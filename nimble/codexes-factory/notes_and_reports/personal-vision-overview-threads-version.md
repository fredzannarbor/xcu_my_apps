# Threads Version: From Nexis to Now

**Thread Structure:** 18 posts, ~250-400 characters each
**Style:** Conversational, personal, with clear narrative progression
**Hook:** Strong opening that promises a journey

**POST 1 (Hook)**
In 2001, I had a crazy idea while working with LexisNexis: What if instead of dumping search results on users, we created actual *reports*? Like e-books that synthesized information into coherent narratives?

Everyone thought I was nuts. Here's what happened over the next 20 years. ðŸ§µ

**POST 2**
The problem was obvious: answer sets sucked. You'd search for something, get 500 documents, and have to piece together the story yourself.

But in 2001, we had no way to fix it. No generative AI. No synthesis capability. Just document assembly and extraction.

**POST 3**
So I waited. And in 2006, I launched Nimble Books to experiment with what books *could* be.

Different page lengths. New annotation systems. Hybrid formats. Each book was a hypothesis about how books should work when you're not bound by convention.

**POST 4**
Then I taught myself to program and built PageKickerâ€”a platform that could create entire books from a single command line.

Give it keywords, it would search Wikipedia, assemble content, format it, and output a complete book.

All written in bash. ðŸ˜…

**POST 5**
Here's what a PageKicker command looked like:

```
bin/builder.sh --seedsviacli "Fancy Bear; Kaspersky" \
               --booktitle "Cybersecurity Demo Book" \
               --covercolor "red"
```

One command. Complete book. Wild times.

**POST 6**
PageKicker was algorithmic curationâ€”taking the answer set and transforming it into something coherent and structured.

But we still couldn't *generate* text. We could only assemble what already existed.

That limitation was about to disappear.

**POST 7**
2019-2020: OpenAI releases GPT-2 and GPT-3.

I immediately wrote a prospectus envisioning authors working with AI "Muses"â€”collaborating on outlines, generating sections, learning from each other.

Finally, actual text generation was possible.

**POST 8**
My vision in 2020:
- AI suggesting structural changes based on what you like
- Section-by-section collaboration
- Human oversight and editing
- Eventually, reader feedback shaping both human and AI work

Sound familiar? We're living in that world now.

**POST 9**
Since 2021, I've been publishing AI-assisted books under "AI Lab for Book-Lovers."

[NOTE TO AUTHOR: Add specific example here]

Real books. Real readers. Human-AI collaboration in practice, not theory.

---

**POST 10**
What surprised me: the technical progression was *faster* than I expected.

What I underestimated: how complex and nuanced human-AI collaboration would be.

The AI doesn't just execute commands. It surprises you. Suggests things you'd never consider. Sometimes writes better than you do.

**POST 11**
But my vision keeps expanding. Here's what I'm working on now:

**Armies of synthetic readers** iterating through thousands of book variations, optimizing for genuine reader satisfaction.

Not A/B testing. Evolutionary optimization at scale.

---

**POST 12**
**Agentic books** that can answer questions, update themselves with new information, and adapt to reader needs.

Books as living systems, not frozen artifacts.

Think research papers that can discuss their own findings.

---

**POST 13**
**Pop-up chatbot communities** where Discord conversations or Reddit threads coalesce into collaborative books.

The AI synthesizes emergent narratives. The community becomes co-authors.

We're not asking "how do we get people to read books?" We're asking "how do we turn conversations into books?"

---

**POST 14**
But here's the real test: **young readers.**

The 9-year-old who says "That's AI!" dismissively when they spot generated content.

The 10-year-old who resents being "parentsplained" via ChatGPT.

---

**POST 15**
These kids grew up with AI everywhere. They're not impressed by synthesis alone.

They're critics. They demand authenticity. They need synthesis that adds genuine value, not just convenience.

If we can't win them over, algorithmic publishing has no future.

---

**POST 16**
The through-line from 2001 to 2025:

Information should be *synthesized into coherent artifacts*, not delivered as raw search results.

The answer set was never the answer. It was a limitation we needed to transcend.

---

**POST 17**
We've moved from:
- Static document assembly
- To dynamic text generation
- To collaborative human-AI authorship
- To (soon) books that think and adapt

The transformation is already here.

---

**POST 18 (CTA)**
The real question: Will we use these capabilities to create genuine value for readers, or just manufacture content at scale?

I've spent 20 years believing we can do better. The tools finally exist to prove it.

If you're working on similar problems, let's connect. ðŸš€

**Alternative Opening (More Provocative):**

**POST 1 ALT**
Hot take: The answer setâ€”that thing you get from Google, LexisNexis, any search engineâ€”has always been broken.

I've spent 20 years trying to fix it. Here's what I've learned about algorithmic publishing, from search results to AI books. ðŸ§µ

---

**Alternative Ending (More Personal):**

**POST 18 ALT**
Still experimenting. Still learning. Still believing that algorithmic publishing can be about value, not spam.

Been at this for 20 years. Just getting started.

What are you building? ðŸ‘‡

**POSTING NOTES:**
- Consider adding a visual to Post 1 (book covers, timeline graphic)
- Post 5 code block may need formatting adjustment for Threads
- Posts 11-13 could be combined if thread feels too long
- Can add engagement questions in comments: "What books would you want an AI to help write?"
- Link to full Substack article in comments or Post 18
