## AI Assistance

### Models Used

All templates default to `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash` for:
- Speed and cost-effectiveness
- Good JSON adherence
- Strong analytical capabilities

Can be overridden per prompt or per tournament.

### Prompt Engineering

Prompts are designed to:
1. Return structured JSON
2. Provide detailed rationale (not just scores)
3. Identify strengths AND weaknesses
4. Suggest improvements
5. Consider market positioning

### Anti-Slop Philosophy

Thaumette's core belief permeates all tournament templates:

> "Books are not content. Readers are not users."

AI evaluation always includes:
- Authenticity checks
- Voice analysis (human vs. AI-generated)
- Literary merit over engagement metrics
- Cultural value assessment

---

## Thaumette Review Integration

For Big Five Killer imprints, tournaments can request Thaumette's final review:

```json
{
  "require_thaumette_review": true
}
```

Thaumette's review focuses on:
- L-Space positioning (does this fill a gap Big Five ignore?)
- Literary merit vs. slop
- Strategic fit with B5K's 575-imprint vision
- Long-term catalog value
- Anti-conglomerate positioning

---

## Examples from Production

Generated 16 book concepts for "Not A Miracle Readers" imprint:
- Started with uploaded CSV of partial ideas
- AI enhanced incomplete concepts
- 16-idea single elimination tournament
- Winner: "The Manatee's Mystery"

Configuration used: `idea_generation.json` (predecessor to current template)

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Criteria

```json
{
  "evaluation_criteria": {
    "default_criteria": [
      "Your New Criterion"
    ],
    "weights": {
      "Your New Criterion": 0.10
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom AI Prompts

```json
{
  "ai_evaluation_prompts": {
    "your_custom_analysis": {
      "system_prompt": "You are an expert...",
      "user_prompt_template": "Analyze {variable}...",
      "variables": ["variable"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Publisher-Specific Configuration

Big Five Killer tournaments automatically:
- Include Thaumette review
- Apply anti-slop measures
- Consider L-Space positioning
- Evaluate gap-filling strategy

Individual imprint tournaments inherit parent publisher's:
- Quality standards
- Anti-slop philosophy
- Brand values
- But maintain editorial autonomy
