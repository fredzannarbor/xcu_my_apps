# The PageKicker Manifesto

_(June 2015)_

This is the guiding team vision document for building PageKicker.

- PageKicker is a software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
- Its CEO and founder is  , who has decades of experience in publishing and information technology for organizations such as NASA, LexisNexis, and the intelligence community.
- PageKicker can be described as a factory for the algorithmic creation of customized e-books.
- All books are built on the fly by robots endowed with developing anthropomorphic personalities.
- Books are defined by catalog entries that can be dynamic and community-modified and express intention rather than final fixed expression.
- Catalog entries can be created by humans using web form or programmatically by analysis of documents, web pages, selected text, social media streams, news feeds, metadata catalogs, or structured and unstructured data sets.
- Catalog entry attributes include keywords, unstructured metadata, search strategies, style, preferences, and design.
- Catalog entries can be associated with fixed content entities such as related documents, images, and videos.
- All book builds include latest permissioned content.
- All book builds use the latest software. New features are readily added to the production pipeline.
- All book builds benefit from latest machine learning against an ever-growing corpus.
- All books follow the Chicago Manual of Style and have customized and unique covers, front matter, body, and back matter with high-quality presentation. They pass the duck test: they look like a book and quack like a book. And sell like a book.
- Building a PageKicker book costs only pennies so prices are low.
- Creating a PageKicker book takes very little time, so barriers are low.
- Books can be added to the catalog via script or spreadsheet thousands at a time.
- PageKicker will rapidly scale to millions of catalog entries and will offer a subscription nonfiction service that provides a compelling alternative to Kindle Unlimited, Oyster, and others.
- PageKicker will rapidly crowd curate and improve major catalog topics that will become compelling reasons for affinity groups to participate and to want to brand their topics.
- Multiple taxonomies are supported including BISAC and Thema.
- Multiple languages are supported including English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish
- The PageKicker catalog includes at least one book for every node in the BISAC nonfiction hierarchy.
- On signup the customer creates a personal authoring robot whose behavior reflects his preferences. He can join and influence a co-curated or branded robot group as well.
- The robots then create shelf of living books that are responsive to the customer's interests and jointly editable with his personal community.
- Enterprise customers can set up private label stores using their own permissioned content and admin backend to serve their own brand.
- PageKicker delivers broad and deep content into "containers" where PageKicker is the reader's partner in immersive learning.  This is an alternative or complementary approach to click-driven web browsing.
- PK is solving the data overload problem by allowing shallow or deep, broad or curated, topic driven and updating content containers that complement learning, entertainment and news functions.
- The size of the financial opportunity includes share of the market for immersive learning, which includes the multi-multi-billion-dollar professional publishing, trade nonfiction, marketing collateral, and branded content markets.
- The size of the financial opportunity also includes a share of the market for search, which includes: trending and updating topics, the social sharing of long tail content, and branded content mixed with trending news
