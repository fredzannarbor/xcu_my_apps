## Identifying Identical and Similar Editions

In book publishing the ability to identify identical and highly similar editions of a given manuscript is important in several use cases.

### Plagiarism detection

No well-intentioned publisher wants to accept and invest in work that involves plagiarism. Not only is it wrong, but it can be costly. Fortunately, there is a healthy, mature industries devoted to antiplagiarism. One estimate has it that anti-plagiarism services market was \$737M in 2021 estimated to rise to $4.8B by 2030. For the moment, suffice it to say that large publishers should definitely shop for anti-plagiarism software and small to medium publishers should consider it.

### Copyright clearance

In the case where it is desired to use material published elsewhere, but with permission, the alternatives are usually to contact the copyright holder directly or to proceed via a clearinghouse such as the Copyright Clearance Center. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find current contact addresses for publishers, authors, and other creators. Aside from repeated searches Google and other tools, there is no automated way to find the current contact information for any given author.
