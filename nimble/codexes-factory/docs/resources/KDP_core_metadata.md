### Clerical Fields

The fields marked with an asterisk are clerical in nature and simply require accurately entering known information. It should not be forgotten, though, that errors in these fields can have a negative impact on the discoverability of your book, can be difficult to correct, can reduce the quality of your readers' experience, and, simply, embarrassing.  In particular:

- Make sure that title and subtitle are exactly the same across all places where you enter book metadata.
- Make sure capitalization is consistent.
- Make sure author names are entered exactly as they appear on the title page of the book;
- Make sure author names are spelled correctly!

It would be possible to create an algorithmic tool to check the consistency and accuracy of these values by querying Amazon's Product Advertising API (PAAPI) and comparing it with the values discovered by querying other sources such as Google Books API, Books In Print, and the Library of Congress. One such tool that relies upon the Google Books API is the open-source **isbntools** package.  


### Free Text Fields

*The remaining fields need to be created by the author or publisher.* This task can be both vitally important to the book's sales and quite time-consuming.
