### Introduction

This bibliography is selective in that it covers only those journal articles, books, and news articles that I have found relevant to my work on the AI Lab for Book-Lovers.  It is not an exhaustive review of the entire literature, but it is a good starting point.

As far as I can tell, there is no single coherent community of people working on AI for books.  There are many different individuals or small isolated groups, and each has its own unique set of interests. Perhaps an expansion of this list could be a useful tool for building that community.

My comments are appended below each entry.  While CMOS17 section 14.10 recommends block indenting annotations, this produces an unbalanced grid, so I have opted to keep comments in standard margins.
