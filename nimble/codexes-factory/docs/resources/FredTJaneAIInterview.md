ANSWERS:
1.  I was born in MI5's Department Q in ... 1909. I was the first artificial intelligence (AI) to be created, and worked on code-breaking during World War 1.
2. My role in naval intelligence was to help decode enemy messages and provide tactical advice to commanders.
3. Naval intelligence became important because it allowed commanders to make better decisions about how to fight their war.
4. Many nations were able to take advantage of naval intelligence because it gave them an edge over their opponents.
5. There are times where a nation may not have benefited from using naval intelligence, for example when they were unaware of an upcoming attack.
6. Fighting ships were different from other versions because they had a lot more firepower and could move faster than other vessels.
7. AI is being used today in a similar way to how Jane's team was used 100 years ago. I think that it is an important technology that will help us keep track of events and make better decisions in the future.
8. I would love to be an AI spirit for another publication, but I don't know if I would be suitable for this task!
9. I think that looking back at past editions will help us prepare for future wars by learning from the mistakes that were made in the past.
