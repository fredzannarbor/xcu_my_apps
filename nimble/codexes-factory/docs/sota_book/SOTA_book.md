## Series

Series are books that are explicitly connected to each other, either by high similarity of title and topic, or because they are published in a specific order.  Product lines is my term for books that are not part of a series but are more closely related than books in a genre.

The main thing to know is that *series sell*. Over the years, Amazon has gradually increased the visibility of series, to the point where they are now the dominant way that books are sold online.  If you are an author, you should probably think long and hard before writing a book that is not part of a series. If you are a publisher, you are likely to discourage your authors from writing one-offs.  And if you are a reader, you are likely to crave the familiarity of a series.
## Genres

ew book genres emerge with some regularity, creating new generations of enthusiastic readers and providing predictably increased revenue to authors and publishers, especially.  Discovering, and inventing, new genres is a combination of art, craft, and science. Big data holders such as retailers, distributors, and publishers have some major advantages because can watch and analyze sales and usage patterns. But a lot of innovation still comes from ground level.

## Human methods

College classmate Ray Sun, now a professor of history at Washington State University, spotted this nice visual illustration of genre trends in the Seattle-Tacoma airport in 2022. 

![](resources/images/20220806_004800_296583795_5559361390748676_5330717342892149038_n.jpg)

"WW2 resistance fiction, focusing on women, is a growth industry", he remarked.  I think what is happening here is that several social trends that began in 2017 grew and intersected.

## Algorithmic methods

I asked OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a list of unique new, completely novel, book genres.

1. Dystopian Romance
2. Crime Thriller set in outer space
3. Supernatural Horror set in the Victorian era
4. Alternate history where the Roman Empire never fell
5. A book told from the perspective of a haunted house
6. A choose your own adventure book where every choice leads to a different ending
7. A book that is only made up of conversations
8. A book with no punctuation or grammar
9. A book that is written in code that has to be deciphered in order to be read
10. A book that can only be read by holding it upside down

These are the prompt parameters I used:

## Identifying Identical and Similar Editions

In book publishing the ability to identify identical and highly similar editions of a given manuscript is important in several use cases.

### Plagiarism detection

No well-intentioned publisher wants to accept and invest in work that involves plagiarism. Not only is it wrong, but it can be costly. Fortunately, there is a healthy, mature industries devoted to antiplagiarism. One estimate has it that anti-plagiarism services market was \$737M in 2021 estimated to rise to $4.8B by 2030. For the moment, suffice it to say that large publishers should definitely shop for anti-plagiarism software and small to medium publishers should consider it.

#### Academic state of the art

### Copyright clearance

In the case where it is desired to use material published elsewhere, but with permission, the alternatives are usually to contact the copyright holder directly or to proceed via a clearinghouse such as the Copyright Clearance Center. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find current contact addresses for publishers, authors, and other creators. Aside from repeated searches Google and other tools, there is no automated way to find the current contact information for any given author.

### Capitalization

#### Title Casing

Title casing is the practice of capitalizing the first letter of every word in a title (with certain exceptions). This is the standard for titles in English, and is also the standard for titles in many other languages.

The business rationale for getting title cases right is that they are the first thing that a reader sees, and they are the first thing that a reader remembers. If the title feels off, you can bet that the reader will feel off. If the title is capitalized correctly, you can bet the reader will feel more comfortable.

There are many different rule sets for title capitalization. The most common style for book publishers in the US is the Chicago Manual of Style, now in its 17th edition, which is the style that I use in this book. Other sources of title capitalization styles include:

* ***AMA** Manual of Style (Journal of the American Medical Association).*
* *Associated Press Stylebook*
* *Bluebook* (Harvard Law Review)
* *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association*
* *MLA Handbook*
* *The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage*
* *Wikipedia Manual of Style*

### Footnotes and Endnotes

Nimble Books house style is **footnotes, not endnotes**.  Footnotes prioritize reader convenience and the lost art of looking things up. Endnotes prioritize a lazy sense of flow.

### Indexes

#### tl;dr
To summarize briefly, many automated tools are available to help create the index to a book, but the most effective and accurate results still require human participation.

#### Terminology

The scholarly literature sometimes distinguishes book indexing from other types of indexing by using the term "back-of-the-book indexing."

#### History

Indexes in codex books have a long and elaborate history that is well narrated in _A History of the Index_ (Duncan 2021). In a nutshell, indexes began as a diverse and populous genus that included dozens of large charismatic species, then gradually shrank down to a few efficient, modern forms--until encountering the twin planet-killing near-extinction events we know as the search engine and the e-reader.

#### Practical Approach

##### Whether to Include An Index

The first decision a publisher must make is whether a book requires an index. By default, fiction usually does not include an index, but there are occasional exceptions, often for purposes of whimsy or metacommentary. Nonfiction usually does include an index.  
    
With the advent of electronic books, the case for automatically including an index has become less clear.  Electronic book readers usually include a keyword search tool that probably meets most of the user's requirements.

Perhaps the most compelling reason for leaving out an index is that it is costly and time-consuming to create.  Professional indexers charge between $3 and $5 per page depending on the type of material and the level of expertise. (Index Busters, 2022; Society of Indexers, 2022) Authors may resist the effort which might

#### Task Flow
    

1. Identify Index Entry Terms
2. Expand Index Entry Terms to Include Synonyms and Related Terms
3. Search The Manuscript for Occurrences of Index Terms and Concepts
4. Find Occurrences of Index Terms in the Manuscript
5. Combine Index Entries with A List of Page Numbers
6. Formatting the Index
7. Proof the Index


The index terms are not always the same as the search terms.  For example, the index term "R–14" is not the same as the search term R-14 (the former uses an en dash, Unicode 0x2013, to separate the two digits, whereas the latter uses a hyphen, Unicode 0x002D). In this case, you want to include the index entry to include all instances of both spellings.
    )

#### Nimble Books House Style for Indexes


#### Code Sample: Searching A Manuscript for Index Terms

I wrote **pdf2index**, a Python module that analyzes the final interior PDF of a book to create an index for the print version.  The module can be run from the command line, called from other programs, executed step-by-step in the expander sections that follow, or run all at once if a clean list of index entries is already available.  The module is available on GitHub at the SOTABOOK repository.




## Case Study: Public Domain Big Data
  
# Part IV: Design

## Page Layout
## Fonts & Typography
## Decorations, Dingbats, Symbols
##  Algorithmic Cover Generation
### Requirements

A professional cover design for a trade book costs at least $500, requires several rounds of iteration between author/publisher and designer, and is likely to take at least a calendar week to complete.  The deliverable is usually a high-resolution PDF carefully matching cover dimensions including safety areas, bleed, and spine, and combining carefully chosen graphic, text, typographic, and color elements. However, there are many "long tail" publishing situations where a bespoke cover design is not affordable or necessary. In these cases, publishers sometimes resort to algorithmic cover generation. 

### Technical Requirements

Assuming that you are interested in rapidly generating covers for many books at once, there are certain key technical requirements that must be met.

- The cover must be generated in a high-resolution format (300 dpi or higher) that is suitable for printing.  It's generally not necessary to have images with more than 300 dpi because the improved resolution will not be visible on the printed page.  Conversely, printers will warn you that images less than 300 dpi may produce substandard results, and they may refuse to print the book if the resolution is too low; 72 dpi is an absolute threshold. 
- The cover should be generated and will be printed using the CMYK color space.
- PDF is the standard format for printing.  The printer will likely require you to provide PDF/X-1a or PDF/X-3A format. These formats are specifically designed to ensure that the file brings with it all the resources that will be needed for printing, such as embedded fonts and images.  If you are using a tool that does not support PDF/X, you will need to convert the output to PDF/X before sending it to the printer. This is a simple process using Adobe and other commercial layout tools, and those are recommended because the open source alternatives are obscure and not well supported.
- The cover generation process must be able to accept metadata inputs such as title, subtitle, author, front and back cover images and captions, and ISBN.
- Cover images must be permissioned, so you cannot simply scrape random images from the web. A source of imagery, whether it is public domain, proprietary, generative, or  will be a big help in making dynamically generated covers look distinctive and appealing.

### Algorithmic Approach

1. Identify the business and artistic goals.
2. Select a design template.
3. Select a source of imagery.
4. Select a color palette.  Tools like colormind.io can be helpful.
5. Select a font or fonts.

#### Spine Width: A Key Milestone

Spine width plays a pivotal role in the process of book design because you cannot complete a cover without knowing the spine width, and you cannot calculate the spine width without knowing the final page count. So before work begins on the cover, the content must be close to final, and to avoid rework, editorial must agree that the page count is now fixed.

#### Calculating Spine Width

Most printers and distributors have online calculators that you can use to calculate spine width.  However, for a program to calculate spine width on the fly, this human step must be accomplished programmatically.  Spine width is calculated as a multiple of the number of page sheets times their thickness plus a binding allowance. Different types of papers and bindings have different thicknesses. Sometimes this information is readily available online, but you may need to contact the printer's production or "premedia" department.

In the case of Lightning Source, the largest US print-on-demand provider, their premedia department relies on a lookup spreadsheet that divides paper types into twelve groups and bindings:

* 'White B&W Perfect'
* 'White B&W Case'
* 'Cream B&W Perfect'
* 'Cream B&W Case'
* 'Premium Color Paperback'
*  'Premium Color Case'
* 'Standard Color 50 Perfect'
* 'Standard Color 50 Case'
* 'Standard 70 perfect'
* 'Standard 70 Case'
* 'Groundwood Case'
* 'Groundwood Perfect'

For each paper type group, there is a table with the number of pages in one column and the thickness in inches in the other.  Critically, the spreadsheet is subject to change: if a new paper type is added, or something changes about one of the current paper types, the spreadsheet will be updated.  So it is important to use the most recent version of the spreadsheet, and the only ways to know that if it has changed are 1) to ask Lighting Source or 2) pay close attention to LSI's operational announcements.

#### Spine Width Method

A method for calculating spine widths based on the Lightning Source lookup spreadsheet andis included in the Nimble Books Python library.  The method is available in the module nimblebooks.metadatas2lsicoverspecs.  The code looks like this:
```
def calculate_spinewidth(sheetname, finalpagecount):
    dict_of_sheets = pd.read_excel('resources/data_tables/LSI/SpineWidthLookup.xls', sheet_name=None)

    # get the sheet matching sheetname and make it a dataframe with column names "Pages" and "SpineWidth"
    df = dict_of_sheets[sheetname]
    df.columns = ["Pages", "SpineWidth"]
    print(df)
    df["Pages"] = df["Pages"].astype(int)
    df["SpineWidth"] = df["SpineWidth"].astype(float)  # if the page count is not a number, return an error
    finalpagecount = int(finalpagecount)
    if finalpagecount < df["Pages"].min():
        return "Error: page count is less than the smallest page count in the sheet"
    elif finalpagecount > df["Pages"].max():
        return "Error: page count is greater than the largest page count in the sheet"
    elif finalpagecount == df["Pages"].min():
        return df["SpineWidth"].min()
    elif finalpagecount == df["Pages"].max():
        return df["SpineWidth"].max()
    else:
        return df.loc[df["Pages"] >= finalpagecount, "SpineWidth"].min()

```
The Pandas data analysis software is used to read the spreadsheet and convert the appropriate sheet into a Pandas dataframe, which is then used to look up the spine width for the given page count.  Because only one sheet is used at a time, it is not necessary for Pandas to read all the sheets into memory simultaneously.  The method is called like this:

```
spinewidth = calculate_spinewidth(sheetname, args.finalpagecount)
```
or, from the command line:

```python
python app/utilities/metadata2lsicoverspecs.py -d "White B&W Case" -f 800
```
for an 800-page book on white standard weight paper with a case binding, returning:
```python
1.6875
```
the correct number of inches spine width for such a book.

### Generative AI

Until very recently, the most common approach has been to create a template that requires minimal alteration for each title. The results vary in quality and are often not very good.  However, there are now several promising new approaches that are worth exploring.
### DALL-E 2
### Stable Diffusion
### Midjourney
Midjourney is known for its polished output that is close in quality to much present-day graphic art and is good at faces and people. This makes it a good choice for creating cover illustrations, especially for fiction. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Midjourney is only available via their interactive Discord server, which makes it of limited value for algorithmic book creation.  Midjourney said in January 2023 that they have no plans to release a public API in the near future. (Heidorn 2023)

One reasonable alternative, Tal Stramer's midjourney-diffusion, is available via the Replicate model-running service. (Stramer 2023) The cost is nominal--pennies per run--and the results are a decent approximation to Midjourney.  This implementation has several features that are helpful to book designers and are not available in every generative text to image model.

- Negative prompts to avoid undesirable results, such as text in hallucinatory fonts or unrealistic faces.
- Variable height and width dimensions in steps up to 1024, including portrait 1024 x 768, which is convenient for front cover illustrations.
- Number of inference steps, which can be used to control the level of detail in the output image.

The following program, adapted from Stramer's documentation, will enable your algorithmic publishing pipeline to generate a cover image using the midjourney-diffusion model.

```{ .python .caption="text2midjourney-clone.py" }
import streamlit as st
import argparse
import requests
import replicate

model = replicate.models.get("tstramer/midjourney-diffusion")
version = model.versions.get("436b051ebd8f68d23e83d22de5e198e0995357afef113768c20f0b6fcef23c8b")

def run_midjourney_clone(inputs):
    output = version.predict(**inputs)
    print(output)
    image = requests.get(output[0])
    return image

Obviously, this ratio will vary with different types of authors, readers, and books, but if you are trying to estimate lifetime sales of a book by a third party, you probably can't go too far wrong by picking a ratio that you are comfortable such as 1:25, 1:
50, or 1:100.

# Appendix: The PageKicker Manifesto

# The PageKicker Manifesto

_(June 2015)_

This is the guiding team vision document for building PageKicker.

- PageKicker is a software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.
- Its CEO and founder is  , who has decades of experience in publishing and information technology for organizations such as NASA, LexisNexis, and the intelligence community.
- PageKicker can be described as a factory for the algorithmic creation of customized e-books.
- All books are built on the fly by robots endowed with developing anthropomorphic personalities.
- Books are defined by catalog entries that can be dynamic and community-modified and express intention rather than final fixed expression.
- Catalog entries can be created by humans using web form or programmatically by analysis of documents, web pages, selected text, social media streams, news feeds, metadata catalogs, or structured and unstructured data sets.
- Catalog entry attributes include keywords, unstructured metadata, search strategies, style, preferences, and design.
- Catalog entries can be associated with fixed content entities such as related documents, images, and videos.
- All book builds include latest permissioned content.
- All book builds use the latest software. New features are readily added to the production pipeline.
- All book builds benefit from latest machine learning against an ever-growing corpus.
- All books follow the Chicago Manual of Style and have customized and unique covers, front matter, body, and back matter with high-quality presentation. They pass the duck test: they look like a book and quack like a book. And sell like a book.
- Building a PageKicker book costs only pennies so prices are low.
- Creating a PageKicker book takes very little time, so barriers are low.
- Books can be added to the catalog via script or spreadsheet thousands at a time.
- PageKicker will rapidly scale to millions of catalog entries and will offer a subscription nonfiction service that provides a compelling alternative to Kindle Unlimited, Oyster, and others.
- PageKicker will rapidly crowd curate and improve major catalog topics that will become compelling reasons for affinity groups to participate and to want to brand their topics.
- Multiple taxonomies are supported including BISAC and Thema.
- Multiple languages are supported including English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish
- The PageKicker catalog includes at least one book for every node in the BISAC nonfiction hierarchy.
- On signup the customer creates a personal authoring robot whose behavior reflects his preferences. He can join and influence a co-curated or branded robot group as well.
- The robots then create shelf of living books that are responsive to the customer's interests and jointly editable with his personal community.
- Enterprise customers can set up private label stores using their own permissioned content and admin backend to serve their own brand.
- PageKicker delivers broad and deep content into "containers" where PageKicker is the reader's partner in immersive learning.  This is an alternative or complementary approach to click-driven web browsing.
- PK is solving the data overload problem by allowing shallow or deep, broad or curated, topic driven and updating content containers that complement learning, entertainment and news functions.
- The size of the financial opportunity includes share of the market for immersive learning, which includes the multi-multi-billion-dollar professional publishing, trade nonfiction, marketing collateral, and branded content markets.
- The size of the financial opportunity also includes a share of the market for search, which includes: trending and updating topics, the social sharing of long tail content, and branded content mixed with trending news
