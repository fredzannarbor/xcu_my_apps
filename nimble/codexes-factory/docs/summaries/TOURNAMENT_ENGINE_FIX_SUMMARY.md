# Tournament Engine AttributeError Fix Summary

## Problem
The Streamlit UI was failing with:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_active_tournaments'
```

This occurred because:
1. The `TournamentEngine` was not being initialized properly (missing required `database` parameter)
2. The `TournamentEngine` class was missing the `get_active_tournaments()` and `get_tournament_history()` methods
3. The UI was calling `execute_tournament()` which didn't exist
4. Method signatures didn't match between UI calls and actual implementations

## Root Causes

### 1. Initialization Issues
- `TournamentEngine` constructor requires a `database` parameter but UI was calling it without arguments
- `IdeationDatabase` constructor requires a `DatabaseManager` parameter but UI was calling it without arguments

### 2. Missing Methods
- `get_active_tournaments()` method was not implemented
- `get_tournament_history()` method was not implemented  
- `execute_tournament()` method was not implemented

### 3. Method Signature Mismatches
- UI called `create_tournament(concepts=..., tournament_name=...)` 
- Actual method expected `create_tournament(name, participants, ...)`

### 4. Missing Fallback Function
- `log_none_encounter()` function was used but not defined in fallback imports

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Initialization Chain
```python
# Initialize database first
from codexes.modules.ideation.storage.database_manager import IdeationDatabase, DatabaseManager
db_path = "data/ideation.db"
db_manager = DatabaseManager(db_path)
self.database = IdeationDatabase(db_manager)

# Initialize tournament engine with database
if self.database:
    self.tournament_engine = TournamentEngine(self.database)
else:
    self.tournament_engine = None
```

### 2. Added Missing Methods to TournamentEngine
```python
def get_active_tournaments(self) -> Dict[str, Tournament]:
    """Get all active tournaments."""
    # Queries database for tournaments with status 'created', 'started', 'in_progress'

def get_tournament_history(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Get tournament history."""
    # Queries database for completed tournaments

def execute_tournament(self, tournament_uuid: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute a tournament by UUID and return results."""
    # Loads tournament and returns results
```

### 3. Fixed Method Signatures
```python
# Before (UI call):
tournament = self.tournament_engine.create_tournament(
    concepts=selected_ideas,
    tournament_name="Quick Tournament"
)

# After (fixed UI call):
tournament = self.tournament_engine.create_tournament(
    name="Quick Tournament",
    participants=selected_ideas,
    config=tournament_config
)
```

### 4. Added Comprehensive None Checks
Added None checks before calling methods on potentially None objects:
```python
def _display_active_tournaments(self):
    if not self.tournament_engine:
        st.warning("Tournament engine not available. Please check system configuration.")
        return
    # ... rest of method
```

### 5. Added Missing Fallback Function
```python
def log_none_encounter(context, component):
    logger.warning(f"None encountered in {context} for {component}")
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/codexes/pages/15_Ideation_and_Development.py**
   - Fixed initialization chain for database and tournament engine
   - Added None checks for all component method calls
   - Fixed method call signatures
   - Added missing `log_none_encounter` fallback function

2. **src/codexes/modules/ideation/tournament/tournament_engine.py**
   - Added `get_active_tournaments()` method
   - Added `get_tournament_history()` method  
   - Added `execute_tournament()` method
   - Added `_dict_to_tournament()` helper method

## Testing Results

✅ Database components initialize successfully
✅ Tournament engine initializes with proper database dependency
✅ All missing methods now exist and return appropriate data
✅ Method signatures match between UI calls and implementations
✅ None checks prevent AttributeError exceptions
✅ All ideation system components initialize properly

## Impact

- **Fixed**: The original `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_active_tournaments'`
- **Improved**: Robust error handling with graceful degradation when components fail to initialize
- **Enhanced**: Proper initialization chain ensures all dependencies are met
- **Maintained**: Backward compatibility with existing functionality

The Streamlit UI should now load without errors and display appropriate warnings when components are unavailable rather than crashing with AttributeErrors.
