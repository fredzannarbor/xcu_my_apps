# ✅ Prompt File Loading Logging Enhancement

## Summary

Added logger.info statements with success icons (✅) to report which prompt files are being loaded across the codebase. This provides better visibility into which prompt files are being used during model calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Prompt Manager (`src/codexes/core/prompt_manager.py`)

**Location**: `load_and_prepare_prompts()` function
**Change**: Added success logging when prompt file is loaded
```python
logger.info(f"✅ Successfully loaded prompts from: {prompt_file_path}")
```

**Impact**: This logs every time the main prompt loading function is called, which covers most LLM interactions in the system.

### 2. LSI Field Completer (`src/codexes/modules/distribution/llm_field_completer.py`)

**Location**: `_load_prompts()` method
**Change**: Added success icon to existing logging
```python
# Before
logger.info(f"Loaded {len(prompts)} LSI field completion prompts from {self.prompts_path}")

# After  
logger.info(f"✅ Loaded {len(prompts)} LSI field completion prompts from {self.prompts_path}")
```

**Impact**: Provides consistent visual feedback when LSI field completion prompts are loaded.

### 3. Imprint Prompt Loading (`src/codexes/imprint.py`)

**Location**: `load_prompts()` method
**Change**: Added success logging for imprint-specific prompts
```python
logger.info(f"✅ Successfully loaded imprint prompts from: {prompts_file}")
```

**Impact**: Logs when imprint-specific prompt files are loaded, helping track which imprint configurations are being used.

### 4. Imprint Builder Prompts (`src/codexes/pages/9_Imprint_Builder.py`)

**Location 1**: Imprint builder prompts loading
```python
logging.info(f"✅ Successfully loaded imprint builder prompts from: {prompt_config_path}")
```

**Location 2**: Base prompts template loading
```python
logging.info(f"✅ Successfully loaded base prompts template from: {base_prompts_path}")
```

**Impact**: Provides visibility into prompt loading during imprint creation and management.

## Benefits

### 1. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Easy to identify which prompt files are being used
- Helps troubleshoot prompt-related issues
- Clear visibility into the prompt loading sequence

### 2. **Consistent Visual Feedback**
- All prompt loading uses the same ✅ success icon
- Uniform logging format across the codebase
- Easy to spot in log files

### 3. **Better Monitoring**
- Track which prompt files are accessed during operations
- Identify if wrong prompt files are being loaded
- Monitor prompt file usage patterns

### 4. **Improved User Experience**
- Clear indication when prompts are successfully loaded
- Helps users understand system behavior
- Provides confidence that the right configurations are being used

## Example Log Output

```
INFO:codexes.core.prompt_manager:✅ Successfully loaded prompts from: prompts/prompts.json
INFO:codexes.modules.distribution.llm_field_completer:✅ Loaded 14 LSI field completion prompts from prompts/lsi_field_completion_prompts.json
INFO:codexes.imprint:✅ Successfully loaded imprint prompts from: imprints/xynapse_traces/prompts.json
```

## Coverage

The logging now covers all major prompt loading scenarios:

1. **Main Prompt Files**: Core system prompts (prompts.json)
2. **LSI Field Completion**: Specialized prompts for field completion
3. **Imprint-Specific**: Custom prompts for different publishing imprints
4. **UI Components**: Prompts used in Streamlit interfaces
5. **Template Loading**: Base prompt templates for imprint generation

## Testing

All changes have been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Core prompt manager logging
- ✅ LSI field completer logging  
- ✅ Imprint prompt loading logging
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Consistent logging format across all locations

## Usage

The logging will automatically appear in the application logs when:
- Running the book pipeline
- Using LSI field completion
- Loading imprint configurations
- Building new imprints
- Any other operation that loads prompt files

No additional configuration is required - the logging uses the existing logger configuration and will appear at INFO level.
