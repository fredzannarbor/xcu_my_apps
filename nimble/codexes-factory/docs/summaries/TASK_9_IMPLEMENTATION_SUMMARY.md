### 2. Mixed-Type Handling Strategies

#### Adaptive Strategy (Default for Low-Medium Complexity)
```python
# Ideas evaluated for concept strength
# Synopses evaluated for plot structure  
# Outlines evaluated for structural soundness
```

#### Normalize Strategy (High Complexity Mixing)
```python
# All content evaluated as if at same development stage
# Reduces bias toward more developed content
```

#### Type-Aware Strategy (Medium Complexity)
```python
# Different importance weights per content type
# Maintains type identity while enabling comparison
```

### 3. Workflow-Specific Adaptations

#### Tournament Adaptations
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Originality, Marketability, Execution Potential, Emotional Impact
- **Mixed-Type Scoring**: Adaptive criteria weights based on content type
- **Results Display**: Type-aware winner analysis and ranking explanations

#### Reader Panel Adaptations
- **Demographic Targeting**: Age, gender, reading level, genre preferences
- **Type-Specific Instructions**: Different evaluation focus per content type
- **Market Analysis**: Type-aware commercial appeal assessment

#### Series Generation Adaptations
- **Consistency Control**: Configurable consistency levels (0.0-1.0)
- **Type-Specific Expansion**: Different generation approaches per base type
- **Franchise Mode**: Extended universe potential for developed concepts
