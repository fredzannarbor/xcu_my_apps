   - Select concepts to evaluate
   - Choose reader personas
   - Click "Evaluate Ideas"

### Advanced Workflow: Series Development

1. **Create Base Concept**
   - Generate a strong base concept
   - Refine through tournaments or reader feedback

2. **Generate Series**
   - Go to "Series Development" tab
   - Select your base concept
   - Configure series parameters (type, formulaicness, book count)
   - Click "Generate Series"

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Review generated series entries
   - Check consistency across books
   - Export for further development

### Batch Operations

1. **Batch Generation**
   - Go to "Batch Processing" tab
   - Set batch size and theme
   - Click "Generate Batch"

2. **Batch Tournament**
   - Select tournament size
   - Click "Run Batch Tournament"
   - Review results and winners

3. **Batch Evaluation**
   - Choose number of concepts to evaluate
   - Click "Run Batch Evaluation"
   - Analyze reader feedback patterns

## Performance Optimization

### Caching

- Resource usage tracking
- Optimization suggestions

### Scaling
- Batch processing for high-volume operations
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Memory management and cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure you're running from the correct directory
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Python path configuration

2. **LLM Connection Issues**
   - Check API keys in configuration
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review rate limits and quotas

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Enable caching for repeated operations
   - Reduce batch sizes if memory is limited
   - Check system resources

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export IDEATION_DEBUG=true
```

### Getting Help
- Check the comprehensive usage guide: `docs/ADVANCED_IDEATION_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- Review error logs in the `logs/` directory
- Contact support with specific error messages

## Migration from Legacy System

If you were using the previous ideation system:

1. **Data Migration**
   - Existing ideas are automatically imported
   - Tournament history is preserved
   - Reader personas are migrated

2. **Configuration**
   - Existing prompt packs are compatible
   - Imprint settings are inherited
   - LLM configurations carry over

3. **Workflows**
   - New interface provides enhanced functionality
   - Legacy workflows are supported
   - Gradual migration recommended
