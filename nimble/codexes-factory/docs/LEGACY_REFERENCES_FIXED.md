# 🎉 Legacy References Successfully Fixed!

## ✅ **All AttributeError Issues Resolved**

The `AttributeError: 'IdeationDashboard' object has no attribute 'integrated_generator'` and related legacy reference errors have been **COMPLETELY FIXED**!

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **Legacy Class References Updated**

1. **`integrated_generator` → `continuous_generator`**
   ```python
   # Before
   self.integrated_generator.start_continuous_generation(imprint, config)
   self.integrated_generator.stop_continuous_generation(imprint)
   self.integrated_generator.get_generator_status(imprint)
   
   # After
   self.continuous_generator.start_continuous_generation(config)
   self.continuous_generator.stop_continuous_generation()
   self.continuous_generator.get_generation_status()
   ```

2. **`tournament_manager` → `tournament_engine`**
   ```python
   # Before
   self.tournament_manager.create_tournament(selected_ideas, tournament_config)
   self.tournament_manager.run_tournament(tournament)
   self.tournament_manager.get_active_tournaments()
   self.tournament_manager.get_tournament_history()
   
   # After
   self.tournament_engine.create_tournament(concepts=selected_ideas, tournament_name="Quick Tournament")
   self.tournament_engine.execute_tournament(tournament.uuid)
   self.tournament_engine.get_active_tournaments()
   self.tournament_engine.get_tournament_history()
   ```

3. **`synthetic_reader_panel` → `reader_panel`**
   ```python
   # Before
   self.synthetic_reader_panel.reader_personas
   self.synthetic_reader_panel.evaluate_ideas(ideas, personas)
   self.synthetic_reader_panel.synthesize_feedback(feedback)
   
   # After
   # Updated to use new reader_panel system with proper API calls
   reader_panel = self.reader_panel.create_diverse_panel(panel_size=len(personas))
   evaluation = self.reader_panel.evaluate_concept(concept, reader_panel)
   ```

### **Method Signature Updates**
