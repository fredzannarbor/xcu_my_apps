# Summary of Changes

## Issue

The mnemonics prompt was not properly receiving the book content due to conflicts between LaTeX curly braces and Python's string formatting. The prompt manager was trying to format LaTeX commands as placeholders, causing errors.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated the mnemonics prompt format**:
   - Changed from a single prompt string to a messages format
   - Used `$book_content$` as a placeholder instead of `{book_content}` to avoid conflicts with LaTeX curly braces

2. **Updated the llm_get_book_data.py file**:
   - Added custom handling for the mnemonics prompt
   - Improved the book content preparation to include all quotes
   - Added a more robust approach to handling LaTeX content

3. **Fixed the prepress.py file**:
   - Fixed the LaTeX escaping for mnemonics
   - Ensured that LaTeX commands are preserved in the mnemonics content

4. **Updated the template.tex file**:
   - Reduced the vertical spacing for mnemonics to 0.5in from the header
   - Fixed page transitions to avoid extra blank pages

## Testing

Created several test scripts to verify the changes:

1. **test_mnemonic_prompt_preparation.py**: Tests the basic prompt preparation
2. **test_mnemonic_llm_call.py**: Tests the LLM call process
3. **test_direct_mnemonics.py**: Tests the direct approach without using the prompt manager
4. **test_mnemonics_with_messages.py**: Tests the new messages format
5. **custom_llm_get_book_data.py**: A custom implementation for testing
6. **test_full_book_pipeline.py**: Tests the full book pipeline

## Results

The changes successfully fixed the issues:

1. The mnemonics prompt now properly receives the book content
2. LaTeX commands are preserved in the mnemonics content
3. The mnemonics section starts 0.5in from the header
4. There are no extra blank pages between sections

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the system to ensure the changes work in production
2. Consider updating other prompts to use the messages format for consistency
3. Add more robust error handling for LaTeX content in prompts
