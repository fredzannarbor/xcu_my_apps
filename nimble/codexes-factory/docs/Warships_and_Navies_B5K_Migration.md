### Imprint Persona

**Before**: Admiral Marcus Hawthorne (fictional persona)

**After**: Jellicoe (AI persona based on Admiral John Jellicoe)

**Jellicoe Background**:
- Based on Admiral John Jellicoe, British Grand Fleet commander at Battle of Jutland (WWI)
- Historical figure known for cautious, methodical approach ("The man who could lose the war in an afternoon")
- Connection to Thaumette: Historical Study - emerged from Thaumette's exploration of military history in L-Space
- Shares Thaumette's love of primary sources and belief that preservation matters more than glory

**Persona Quote from Thaumette**:
> "I discovered Jellicoe while exploring L-Space's military history dimension. He was controversial - cautious, methodical, criticized for not destroying the German fleet at Jutland. But his approach was preservation: 'The man who could lose the war in an afternoon.' I understood that immediately. Publishing is the same - one reckless decision can destroy everything you've built. Jellicoe's AI persona emerged from my study of his dispatches, his measured strategic thinking, his understanding that some victories come from not losing. He shares my love of primary sources and my belief that preservation matters more than glory."

### Branding Updates

- **Added Glyph**: ⚓ (anchor symbol for Jellicoe)
- **Accent Color**: Added #DAA520 (gold) to align with B5K branding
- **Parent Publisher Reference**: Now includes connection to Thaumette (ℵ⊗)

## Market Strategy

### Gap Filled

**Market Size**: $150M+ naval history market

### Competitive Positioning

- **vs. Big Five**: They don't compete here; they've abandoned the category
- **vs. Academic Presses**: Warships & Navies is more accessible, better production quality, faster
- **vs. Small Military History Publishers**: Professional infrastructure, AI-enhanced metadata, global distribution
