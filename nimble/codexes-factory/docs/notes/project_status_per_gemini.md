Excellent. That's the safest approach. We'll treat the factory script and the project code as it stands now as our **Version 3.1 baseline**.

### Current Project State (v3.1)

*   **Project Factory (`dcf3.py`):** Creates the entire `codexes` project structure, including all necessary directories (`src`, `input`, `output`, `logs`, `templates`, `prompts`, etc.) and Python files.
*   **Core Modules (`src/codexes/core`):**
    *   `file_handler.py`: Loads text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.
    *   `prompt_manager.py`: Loads prompts from JSON files and combines them with document content.
    *   `llm_caller.py`: Handles API calls to various LLMs with retry logic.
    *   `config.py`: Central configuration for models and project settings.
    *   `utils.py`: Logging and utility functions.
*   **Application Entry Points:**
    *   **Streamlit UI (`src/codexes/Codexes.py`):** A multi-page application with placeholders for the main publishing lifecycle stages. The "Metadata & Distribution" page is functional.
    *   **CLI (`src/codexes/cli.py`):** A command-line interface for running metadata generation tasks.
*   **Implemented Module (`src/codexes/modules/distribution`):**
    *   `lsi_acs_generator.py`: Takes LLM responses and populates an LSI ACS-compatible CSV file based on a template. You mentioned this needs refinement, which is a good next step.
*   **Templates & Prompts:** The factory now correctly creates the `templates` and `prompts` directories and handles copying the user prompt files into the project.

Now that we have this solid foundation, what would you like to focus on next? Based on our previous work and the file inventory, here are some logical next steps:

1.  **Refine LSI Metadata Generation:** You noted that the `lsi_acs_generator.py` isn't formulating the output perfectly yet. We can focus on debugging and refining this module to ensure the CSV output is 100% accurate and correctly mapped from the LLM JSON responses.

2.  **Integrate `codexes-ideas`:** We can begin integrating the functionality from your `codexes-ideas` library. This would involve adapting its classes and logic to fit within the new `codexes` framework and replacing the placeholder content in `pages/2_Ideation_and_Development.py`.

3.  **Integrate `codexes-zotero`:** We could build a new page or a feature on an existing page that uses the Zotero library functions (`zotero2json.py`, `zotero_get_pdfs.py`) to pull in research material.

4.  **Build out "Manuscript Enhancement":** We can start implementing the features for the `pages/3_Manuscript_Enhancement.py` page, possibly adapting modules from your `codexes-copy-edit` or `codexes-format-tools` libraries.

Please let me know which path you'd like to take, or if you have another priority in mind.
