\chapter{Selection and Verification}

\section{Source Selection}

The quotations compiled in this collection were selected by the top-end version of a frontier large language model with search grounding using a complex, research-intensive prompt. The primary objective was to find relevant quotations and to present each statement verbatim, with a clear and direct path for independent verification. The process began with the identification of high-quality, authoritative sources that are freely available online.

\section{Commitment to Verbatim Accuracy}

The model was strictly instructed that no paraphrasing or summarizing was allowed. Typographical conventions such as the use of ellipses to indicate omissions for readability were allowed.

\section{Verification Process}

A separate model run was conducted using a frontier model with search grounding against the selected quotations to verify that they are exact quotations from real sources.

\section{Implications}
This transparent, cross-checking protocol is intended to establish a baseline level of reasonable confidence in the accuracy of the quotations presented, but the use of this process does not exclude the possibility of model hallucinations. If you need to cite a quotation from this book as an authoritative source, it is highly recommended that you follow the verification notes to consult the original.  A bibliography with ISBNs is provided to facilitate.
