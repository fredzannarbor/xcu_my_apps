# Nimble LLM Caller Integration Requirements

## Overview
Integrate the nimble-llm-caller package into the codexes-factory project to replace the existing LLM calling infrastructure with a cleaner, more maintainable solution.

## User Stories

### Core Integration
- **As a developer**, I want all existing LLM functionality to work through the new nimble-llm-caller package
- **As a developer**, I want to remove duplicate LLM calling code from the codebase
- **As a developer**, I want improved error handling and retry logic for LLM calls
- **As a developer**, I want better logging and monitoring of LLM operations
- **As a developer**, I want consistent LLM calling patterns across all modules

### Migration Goals
- **As a developer**, I want existing prompts migrated to the new JSON format
- **As a developer**, I want configuration consolidated into the new system
- **As a developer**, I want no regression in existing functionality
- **As a developer**, I want improved performance and reliability

### Maintenance Benefits
- **As a developer**, I want reduced code duplication across the project
- **As a developer**, I want easier testing with mock LLM calls
- **As a developer**, I want better separation of concerns between business logic and LLM calling
- **As a developer**, I want standardized error handling patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] nimble-llm-caller package installed as dependency in codexes-factory
- [ ] All existing LLM calls updated to use nimble-llm-caller
- [ ] Existing prompts migrated to JSON format
- [ ] Configuration updated to use new configuration system
- [ ] All tests pass with new implementation
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### Code Quality
- [ ] Remove duplicate LLM calling code
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Improve logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add proper type hints throughout
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new architecture

### Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Performance matches or exceeds current implementation
- [ ] Improved retry logic and error recovery
- [ ] Better handling of rate limits and API errors
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Add nimble-llm-caller to project dependencies
- Ensure compatibility with existing Python version requirements
- Update requirements.txt and any other dependency files

### Migration Strategy
- Phase 1: Install package and create compatibility layer
- Phase 2: Migrate core LLM calling functions
- Phase 3: Update all modules to use new system
- Phase 4: Remove old LLM calling code
- Phase 5: Update tests and documentation

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing API interfaces during transition
- Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
- Provide migration path for any breaking changes
- Update documentation with migration guide

## Success Metrics
- All existing LLM functionality works through new package
- Reduced lines of code through elimination of duplication
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Better performance and reliability metrics
- Easier testing and debugging capabilities

## Risk Mitigation
- Gradual migration approach to minimize disruption
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Rollback plan if issues are discovered
- Performance benchmarking to ensure no regression
