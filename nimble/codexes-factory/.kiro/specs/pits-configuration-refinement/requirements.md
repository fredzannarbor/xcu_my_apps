# PITS Configuration Refinement Requirements

## Introduction

This project refines and completes the existing PITS (Publisher, Imprint, Tranche, Series) configuration system in codexes-factory. The system already has partial implementation with publishers, imprints, and tranches directories, but needs consolidation, standardization, and completion to provide a robust multi-tenant publishing configuration architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Structure Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified configuration structure that clearly separates business logic from system configuration, so that I can easily manage multiple publishers, imprints, and tranches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation between system configs and business configs
2. WHEN accessing configurations THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical inheritance (publisher → imprint → tranche → series)
3. WHEN adding new entities THEN the system SHALL provide template files for easy setup
4. WHEN validating configurations THEN the system SHALL ensure all required fields are present
5. WHEN loading configurations THEN the system SHALL merge configurations according to hierarchy rules

### Requirement 2: Configuration Loading and Inheritance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic configuration inheritance and merging, so that I can define settings at the appropriate level and have them cascade down the hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading tranche configuration THEN the system SHALL inherit from imprint and publisher configurations
2. WHEN loading imprint configuration THEN the system SHALL inherit from publisher configuration
3. WHEN merging configurations THEN child configurations SHALL override parent configurations
4. WHEN configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL use the most specific (child) configuration
5. WHEN configurations are missing THEN the system SHALL provide sensible defaults

### Requirement 3: Asset Organization and Management

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want imprint-specific assets (templates, prompts, scripts) organized logically, so that I can easily manage different publishing brands and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing imprint assets THEN the system SHALL keep templates, prompts, and scripts in imprint-specific directories
2. WHEN accessing assets THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms for missing imprint-specific assets
3. WHEN adding new imprints THEN the system SHALL support asset inheritance from templates
4. WHEN managing assets THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts between different imprints
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support imprint-specific asset deployment

### Requirement 4: Configuration Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration validation, so that I can catch configuration errors early and get helpful error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading configurations THEN the system SHALL validate JSON schema compliance
2. WHEN validating inheritance THEN the system SHALL check for circular dependencies
3. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with file paths
4. WHEN required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL specify which fields are missing and where
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent system startup with clear error reporting

### Requirement 5: Migration and Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want smooth migration from the current mixed configuration system, so that existing functionality continues to work during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing file paths
2. WHEN old configurations exist THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities
3. WHEN both old and new configurations exist THEN the system SHALL prefer new configurations with warnings
4. WHEN migration is incomplete THEN the system SHALL continue to function with degraded capabilities
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove deprecated configuration paths

### Requirement 6: Development and Debugging Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent debugging and development support for the configuration system, so that I can easily troubleshoot configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN debugging configurations THEN the system SHALL provide configuration resolution tracing
2. WHEN configurations are loaded THEN the system SHALL log the inheritance chain and final merged configuration
3. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide stack traces with configuration context
4. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support configuration hot-reloading for faster iteration
5. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for configuration mocking and testing

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient configuration loading and caching, so that the system performs well even with many publishers and imprints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading configurations THEN the system SHALL cache parsed configurations to avoid repeated file I/O
2. WHEN configurations change THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant caches
3. WHEN scaling to many entities THEN the system SHALL load configurations lazily as needed
4. WHEN memory usage is a concern THEN the system SHALL provide configuration garbage collection
5. WHEN performance is critical THEN the system SHALL complete configuration loading within 100ms per entity

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Tooling

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want comprehensive documentation and tooling for the configuration system, so that I can quickly understand and work with the PITS architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the system THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of the PITS hierarchy
2. WHEN creating configurations THEN the system SHALL provide CLI tools for generating templates
3. WHEN validating configurations THEN the system SHALL provide CLI tools for validation and testing
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide CLI tools for configuration inspection and tracing
5. WHEN onboarding THEN the system SHALL provide examples and tutorials for common configuration scenarios
