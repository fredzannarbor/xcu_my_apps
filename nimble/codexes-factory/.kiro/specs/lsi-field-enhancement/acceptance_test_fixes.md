# LSI Field Enhancement Acceptance Test Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **LLM Completion Storage**: LLM completion model responses are not being saved in the expected directory structure (metadata/ parallel to covers/ and interiors/).

2. **LSI CSV Output**: LLM completions from lsi_field_completion_prompts are not being included in the final LSI CSV output.

3. **Field Completion Visibility**: Need a checklist table showing which fields are being completed by which strategy and their actual values.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Fix LLM Completion Storage

- [ ] 1.1 Modify LLMFieldCompleter to save responses in metadata/ directory
  - Update the `complete_missing_fields` method to save responses to disk
  - Create directory structure parallel to covers/ and interiors/
  - Save responses in JSON format with timestamp and metadata ID
  - Add configuration option for output directory

### 2. Ensure LLM Completions in LSI CSV Output

- [ ] 2.1 Verify field mapping from LLM completions to CSV
  - Audit the field mapping registry to ensure LLM completions are properly mapped
  - Add explicit mapping for each field in lsi_field_completion_prompts.json
  - Test with sample data to verify completions appear in CSV

- [ ] 2.2 Update LLMCompletionStrategy
  - Ensure the strategy correctly retrieves values from llm_completions
  - Add fallback to direct field access if not in llm_completions
  - Add logging for field completion source

### 3. Create Field Completion Report

- [ ] 3.1 Implement field completion report generator
  - Create a new class `LSIFieldCompletionReporter`
  - Add method to generate field strategy report
  - Include columns: field name, field strategy, actual value, source
  - Output as CSV and HTML formats

- [ ] 3.2 Integrate with Book Pipeline
  - Add option to generate field completion report in run_book_pipeline.py
  - Save report alongside LSI CSV output
  - Add summary statistics to pipeline output

### 4. Verify Book Pipeline Integration

- [ ] 4.1 Create comprehensive test with live API/real books
  - Set up test with real book data from production
  - Run full pipeline with LLM completion enabled
  - Verify all expected fields are completed
  - Generate and analyze field completion report

- [ ] 4.2 Add validation checks
  - Add checks for critical LSI fields
  - Implement warning system for incomplete fields
  - Create field completion percentage metric

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test LLMFieldCompleter with mock responses
   - Test field mapping with sample data
   - Test report generator with known input

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full pipeline with sample book
   - Verify file storage locations
   - Check CSV output against expected values

3. **Acceptance Tests**:
   - Run with real book data
   - Verify all fields are properly populated
   - Check report for field completion strategies
   - Validate against LSI requirements

## Deliverables

1. Updated LLMFieldCompleter with proper storage
2. Fixed field mapping for LLM completions
3. Field completion report generator
4. Book Pipeline integration
5. Comprehensive test results
6. Documentation updates
