   @dataclass
   class BookMetadata:
       isbn13: str
       title: str
       subtitle: Optional[str]
       author: str
       series_name: Optional[str]

### Configuration Hierarchy

The system implements a five-level configuration hierarchy:

1. **Global Default** - Base configuration for all books
2. **Publisher Specific** - Publisher-level overrides and branding
3. **Imprint Specific** - Imprint branding and editorial focus
4. **Tranche Specific** - Series or collection-level settings
5. **Book Specific** - Individual book overrides

Each level can override values from lower-priority levels, with runtime resolution based on the configuration context.
