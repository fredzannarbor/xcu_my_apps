# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating an academic paper documenting the AI-assisted creation of the xynapse_traces publishing imprint. The paper will be submitted to arXiv and will document the first known instance of using AI to create an entire publishing imprint from scratch, including the technical implementation within the Codexes-Factory platform. The paper will serve as a comprehensive case study demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be integrated into traditional publishing workflows to create an entire imprint from conception to production.
