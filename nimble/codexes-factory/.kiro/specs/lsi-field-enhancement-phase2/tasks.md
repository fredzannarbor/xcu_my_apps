    - Add generate_field_strategy_report method
    - Create _generate_report_data method for data collection
    - Implement _determine_field_source method for source tracking
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

  - [x] 3.2 Add multiple output format support
    - Implement _generate_csv_report method
    - Create _generate_html_report method with statistics and formatting
    - Add _generate_json_report method for programmatic access
    - Ensure consistent file naming and organization
    - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

  - [x] 3.3 Add statistics and visualization
    - Calculate field population rates and strategy usage
    - Create visually appealing HTML reports with progress bars
    - Add color coding for empty fields and potential issues
    - Include book metadata information for context
    - _Requirements: 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 4. Integrate with Book Pipeline
  - [x] 4.1 Update run_book_pipeline.py to use the new reporter
    - Add import for LSIFieldCompletionReporter
    - Initialize reporter with field mapping registry
    - Generate reports for each book in the batch
    - Save reports alongside LSI CSV files
    - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_

  - [x] 4.2 Add backward compatibility and error handling
    - Add fallback to existing report generator
    - Ensure reports are generated even if some steps fail
    - Add error handling to continue processing
    - Improve logging for report generation
    - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 5. Create comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] 5.1 Write unit tests for enhanced components
