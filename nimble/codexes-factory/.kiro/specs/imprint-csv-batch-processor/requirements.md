# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current `expand_imprint_cli.py` tool only processes single text files containing imprint concepts. This enhancement will extend the tool to support batch processing of imprint concepts from CSV files and directory scanning, enabling efficient processing of multiple imprints with specified attributes and subattributes for expansion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want to process multiple imprint concepts from a CSV file, so that I can efficiently expand many imprints at once with consistent attribute specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a CSV file with imprint concepts THEN the tool SHALL read each row as a separate imprint concept
2. WHEN the CSV contains an "imprint_concept" column THEN the tool SHALL use that text as the concept description
3. WHEN I specify attribute and subattribute parameters THEN the tool SHALL focus expansion on those specific areas
4. WHEN processing multiple concepts THEN the tool SHALL generate separate output files for each imprint
5. IF any row fails processing THEN the tool SHALL continue with remaining rows and report errors at the end

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want to process all CSV files in a directory, so that I can batch process imprints organized across multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a directory path THEN the tool SHALL scan for all CSV files in that directory
2. WHEN multiple CSV files are found THEN the tool SHALL process each file sequentially
3. WHEN processing directory contents THEN the tool SHALL create organized output structure preserving file relationships
4. IF a directory contains non-CSV files THEN the tool SHALL ignore them and continue processing
5. WHEN directory processing completes THEN the tool SHALL provide a summary report of all processed files
6. WHEN a row contains blank values THEN by default the tool SHALL enhance the blank column values
7. WHEN a row contains non-blank values THEN by default the tool SHALL accept the column value if it is a constrained value

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want to specify which attributes and subattributes to focus on during expansion, so that I can control the scope and depth of imprint enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify attribute parameters THEN the tool SHALL focus expansion only on those attributes
2. WHEN I specify subattribute parameters THEN the tool SHALL enhance only those specific subattributes
3. WHEN no attributes are specified THEN the tool SHALL enhance all available attributes by default
4. IF invalid attribute names are provided THEN the tool SHALL report validation errors before processing
5. WHEN attribute filtering is applied THEN the tool SHALL preserve existing values for non-targeted attributes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want flexible CSV column mapping, so that I can use existing CSV files without reformatting them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSV has different column names THEN the tool SHALL support configurable column mapping
2. WHEN I specify column mappings THEN the tool SHALL use those instead of default column names
3. WHEN CSV contains additional columns THEN the tool SHALL preserve them in metadata
4. IF required columns are missing THEN the tool SHALL report clear error messages
5. WHEN column mapping is used THEN the tool SHALL validate all mappings before processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want comprehensive error handling and reporting, so that I can identify and resolve issues in batch processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing fails for any imprint THEN the tool SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the tool SHALL provide a summary report with success/failure counts
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the tool SHALL continue processing remaining items
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the tool SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the tool SHALL generate a processing log file with all operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want output organization options, so that I can control how batch-processed results are structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing multiple imprints THEN the tool SHALL support different output organization strategies
2. WHEN I specify output directory THEN the tool SHALL create organized subdirectories for each imprint
3. WHEN processing CSV files THEN the tool SHALL support naming output files based on imprint names or row numbers
4. IF output files would conflict THEN the tool SHALL use unique naming strategies
5. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the tool SHALL create an index file listing all generated outputs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a publishing operations manager, I want command-line interface compatibility with the existing tool, so that I can integrate batch processing into existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the enhanced tool THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing single-file processing
2. WHEN I provide the same arguments as the original tool THEN it SHALL produce identical results
3. WHEN new batch processing options are added THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing parameters
4. IF both single file and batch options are provided THEN the tool SHALL report clear usage errors
5. WHEN help is requested THEN the tool SHALL display comprehensive usage examples for both modes
