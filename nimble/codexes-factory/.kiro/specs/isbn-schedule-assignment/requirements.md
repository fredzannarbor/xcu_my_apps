# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ISBN Schedule Assignment feature provides a comprehensive system for managing ISBN assignments across publishing schedules. This feature allows publishers to efficiently allocate ISBNs to books, track their usage, and manage ISBN blocks from registration authorities. The system supports both manual and bulk operations, provides detailed reporting, and integrates with the existing Codexes Factory publishing pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to manage ISBN blocks and ranges, so that I can efficiently allocate ISBNs from my registered blocks to upcoming book publications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new ISBN block THEN the system SHALL store the prefix, publisher code, imprint code, start number, end number, and total count
2. WHEN I view ISBN blocks THEN the system SHALL display utilization statistics including used, reserved, and available ISBNs
3. WHEN I add an ISBN block with invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL reject the block and provide clear error messages
4. IF an ISBN block overlaps with existing blocks THEN the system SHALL warn about potential conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to schedule ISBN assignments for upcoming books, so that I can plan publication schedules and ensure ISBNs are available when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I schedule an ISBN assignment THEN the system SHALL automatically assign the next available ISBN from appropriate blocks
2. WHEN I schedule an assignment THEN the system SHALL store book title, book ID, scheduled date, imprint, publisher, format, priority, and notes
3. WHEN no ISBNs are available THEN the system SHALL reject the assignment and notify me of the shortage
4. WHEN I schedule an assignment THEN the system SHALL update block utilization counts automatically
5. IF I specify an imprint or publisher THEN the system SHALL prioritize matching ISBN blocks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a production coordinator, I want to view and manage scheduled ISBN assignments, so that I can track upcoming publications and make adjustments as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view assignments THEN the system SHALL display ISBN, title, book ID, scheduled date, status, and other metadata
2. WHEN I filter assignments by status THEN the system SHALL show only assignments matching the selected status
3. WHEN I filter assignments by date range THEN the system SHALL show only assignments within the specified dates
4. WHEN I search assignments THEN the system SHALL find matches in title, ISBN, or book ID fields
5. WHEN I select an assignment THEN the system SHALL allow me to assign, reserve, edit, or view details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to assign ISBNs immediately when books are ready for publication, so that I can move books from scheduled to active status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I assign an ISBN THEN the system SHALL change status from scheduled to assigned
2. WHEN I assign an ISBN THEN the system SHALL record the assignment date and time
3. WHEN I try to assign a non-existent ISBN THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with an error message
4. WHEN I assign an ISBN THEN the system SHALL update all related reports and statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to reserve ISBNs for special projects, so that I can prevent them from being automatically assigned to regular publications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I reserve an ISBN THEN the system SHALL change its status to reserved
2. WHEN I reserve an ISBN THEN the system SHALL require and store a reservation reason
3. WHEN I reserve an ISBN THEN the system SHALL exclude it from automatic assignment pools
4. WHEN I view reserved ISBNs THEN the system SHALL display the reservation reason and date

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want to update existing ISBN assignments, so that I can correct information or adjust schedules as publication plans change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I update an assignment THEN the system SHALL allow changes to title, book ID, scheduled date, priority, and notes
2. WHEN I update an assignment THEN the system SHALL validate all changes before saving
3. WHEN I try to update a non-existent assignment THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with an error message
4. WHEN I update an assignment THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to generate comprehensive reports on ISBN usage and availability, so that I can make informed decisions about ordering new ISBN blocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I generate an availability report THEN the system SHALL show total, used, reserved, and available ISBNs
