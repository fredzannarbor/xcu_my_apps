# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses improvements to the logging system to reduce noise, improve readability, and provide better visibility into LLM usage patterns. The current logging system is cluttered with verbose LiteLLM messages that make it difficult to track actual application behavior and LLM usage costs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Filter LiteLLM Noise

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter out verbose LiteLLM logging messages so that I can focus on application-specific logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN LiteLLM cost calculation messages SHALL be filtered out by default
2. WHEN the application runs THEN LiteLLM completion wrapper messages SHALL be filtered out by default
3. WHEN the application runs THEN LiteLLM utility messages SHALL be filtered out by default
4. IF debug mode is enabled THEN LiteLLM messages MAY be shown at debug level
5. WHEN filtering is applied THEN application performance SHALL not be significantly impacted

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Prompt Call Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see prompt names in LLM call logs so that I can track which prompts are being executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM call is made THEN the prompt name SHALL be logged before the success icon and text
2. WHEN multiple prompts are processed THEN each prompt name SHALL be clearly identifiable in logs
3. WHEN prompt names are logged THEN they SHALL use a consistent format for easy parsing
4. WHEN prompt calls fail THEN the prompt name SHALL still be logged for debugging

### Requirement 3: Improved Log Readability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want log messages to be well-formatted and readable so that I can quickly understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompt names are logged THEN they SHALL appear before success icons and descriptive text
2. WHEN log messages are formatted THEN they SHALL follow a consistent pattern
3. WHEN multiple related log entries exist THEN they SHALL be visually grouped or clearly separated
4. WHEN timestamps are shown THEN they SHALL use a readable format

### Requirement 4: Token Usage and Cost Statistics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see token usage and cost statistics at the end of pipeline runs so that I can monitor LLM resource consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pipeline run completes THEN total token usage SHALL be reported
2. WHEN a pipeline run completes THEN estimated costs SHALL be calculated and reported
3. WHEN statistics are reported THEN they SHALL be broken down by model type
4. WHEN statistics are reported THEN they SHALL include both input and output tokens
5. WHEN multiple prompts are used THEN statistics SHALL show usage per prompt type
6. WHEN cost calculation fails THEN a warning SHALL be logged but execution SHALL continue

### Requirement 5: Configurable Logging Levels

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure logging levels so that I can control the verbosity of different components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging is configured THEN LiteLLM logging level SHALL be configurable separately
2. WHEN logging is configured THEN application logging level SHALL be configurable separately
3. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN additional diagnostic information SHALL be available
4. WHEN production mode is used THEN logging SHALL be optimized for performance
