# Advanced Ideation Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating advanced ideation capabilities from the `integrate_ideas` and `integrate_synthetic_readers` directories into the existing codexes-factory ideation module. The goal is to transform the current basic ideation system into a comprehensive, enterprise-level idea generation and validation platform.

1. WHEN a user initiates batch processing THEN the system SHALL handle hundreds of Codex objects simultaneously
2. WHEN batch processing runs THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and estimated completion times
3. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL implement automatic error recovery and retry logic
4. WHEN batch operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with success/failure statistics
5. WHEN automated processing is configured THEN the system SHALL support scheduled batch operations
6. WHEN batch processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue processing remaining items

### Requirement 5: Synthetic Reader Panel Integration

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to test my Codex objects with synthetic reader panels representing different demographics so that I can validate market appeal before investing in development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits Codex objects for evaluation THEN the system SHALL create diverse synthetic reader panels with configurable demographics
2. WHEN synthetic readers evaluate Codex objects THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic reading preferences based on age, gender, genre preferences, and reading level
3. WHEN reader evaluations are complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback including sentiment analysis and preference scoring
4. WHEN multiple readers evaluate the same Codex object THEN the system SHALL aggregate results and identify consensus patterns
5. WHEN reader panel results are generated THEN the system SHALL provide demographic breakdowns and market appeal insights
6. WHEN evaluation data is collected THEN the system SHALL support consistency analysis to validate reader reliability

### Requirement 6: Continuous Codex object Generation Engine

**User Story:** As a content strategist, I want to run continuous Codex object generation processes that produce and evaluate Codex objects automatically so that I can maintain a steady pipeline of creative concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN continuous generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate Codex objects at configurable intervals
2. WHEN the generation engine runs THEN the system SHALL automatically save results to cumulative datasets
3. WHEN continuous processing occurs THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress monitoring and performance metrics
4. WHEN generation batches complete THEN the system SHALL automatically run tournaments on generated Codex objects
