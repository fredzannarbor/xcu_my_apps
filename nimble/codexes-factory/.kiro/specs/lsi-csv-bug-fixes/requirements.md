# LSI CSV Bug Fixes Project - Requirements

## Introduction

This project focuses on identifying and fixing bugs in the existing LSI CSV generation system within the Codexes Factory codebase. The goal is to improve reliability, accuracy, and completeness of LSI CSV file generation for IngramSpark submissions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix JSON Parsing Errors in LLM Responses

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LLM responses to consistently return valid JSON, so that the LSI field completion process doesn't fail with parsing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM prompts are executed THEN the system SHALL receive valid JSON responses
2. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN prompts return conversational text THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with fallbacks
4. WHEN using modernized prompts THEN the system SHALL enforce JSON-only responses
5. WHEN LLM responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL log the issue and continue processing

### Requirement 2: Improve Field Completion Accuracy

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want LSI fields to be populated with accurate, relevant content, so that my book submissions are accepted by IngramSpark.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating BISAC codes THEN the system SHALL provide valid, current BISAC classifications
2. WHEN creating descriptions THEN the system SHALL respect character limits and formatting requirements
3. WHEN determining age ranges THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate values based on content
4. WHEN generating keywords THEN the system SHALL create relevant, searchable terms
5. WHEN completing contributor information THEN the system SHALL generate professional, accurate bios

### Requirement 3: Fix Validation Logic Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the validation system to correctly identify and report LSI compliance issues, so that generated CSV files meet IngramSpark requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating field lengths THEN the system SHALL correctly enforce LSI character limits
2. WHEN checking required fields THEN the system SHALL accurately identify missing mandatory data
3. WHEN validating formats THEN the system SHALL properly check dates, ISBNs, and other structured fields
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL guarantee LSI compliance

### Requirement 4: Resolve Configuration Loading Problems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration files to load correctly and apply settings properly, so that publisher and imprint-specific customizations work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading multi-level configs THEN the system SHALL properly inherit and override settings
2. WHEN configuration files are missing THEN the system SHALL use appropriate defaults
3. WHEN config syntax is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN applying tranche settings THEN the system SHALL correctly merge configurations
5. WHEN config changes are made THEN the system SHALL reload without restart

### Requirement 5: Fix Batch Processing Failures

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want batch processing to handle errors gracefully and complete successfully, so that I can process multiple books without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN one book fails in a batch THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining books
2. WHEN batch processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN memory issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle large batches efficiently
4. WHEN processing is interrupted THEN the system SHALL provide resume capability
5. WHEN batch completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive success/failure reports

### Requirement 6: Improve Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly diagnose and fix issues in the LSI generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed context and stack traces
2. WHEN processing books THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN LLM calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with backoff
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL log specific field issues and suggested fixes
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options

### Requirement 7: Fix Field Mapping and Transformation Issues

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want book metadata to be correctly mapped to LSI fields, so that all relevant information appears in the proper CSV columns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping metadata fields THEN the system SHALL correctly transform data types and formats
2. WHEN handling missing source data THEN the system SHALL apply intelligent defaults or AI completion
3. WHEN processing complex fields THEN the system SHALL properly parse and format structured data
4. WHEN applying field rules THEN the system SHALL correctly implement publisher-specific mappings
5. WHEN transforming content THEN the system SHALL preserve data integrity and meaning

### Requirement 8: Resolve Performance and Memory Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LSI generation system to run efficiently without memory leaks or performance degradation, so that it can handle production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large books THEN the system SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN running batch jobs THEN the system SHALL maintain stable memory usage
3. WHEN making LLM calls THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching and rate limiting
4. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL use streaming and pagination appropriately
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle limitations
