# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the recurring issues with the Streamlit Imprint Builder UI where autofix reverts critical robustness fixes, causing crashes due to None value handling and iteration errors. The goal is to create a permanent, autofix-resistant solution that ensures the UI remains bulletproof against all data scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Autofix-Resistant Code Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI robustness fixes to persist through autofix operations, so that the application remains stable and doesn't crash on None values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autofix runs on the UI files THEN the safe access patterns SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN the UI encounters None values in any data structure THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
3. IF autofix modifies the UI code THEN the core robustness patterns SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN iteration operations are performed on potentially None collections THEN they SHALL use safe access patterns

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive None Value Handling

**User Story:** As a user of the Imprint Builder, I want the UI to work reliably regardless of the data state, so that I can use all features without encountering crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any attribute in the design specifications is None THEN the UI SHALL provide sensible defaults
2. WHEN typography or color_palette attributes are None THEN the UI SHALL use empty dictionaries as fallbacks
3. WHEN list attributes like trim_sizes or primary_genres are None THEN the UI SHALL use empty lists as fallbacks
4. WHEN displaying validation results with None errors or warnings THEN the UI SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 3: Safe Iteration Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all iteration operations in the UI to be safe from NoneType errors, so that the application never crashes due to iteration over None values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN iterating over design.trim_sizes THEN the code SHALL use safe access patterns
2. WHEN iterating over publishing.primary_genres THEN the code SHALL use safe access patterns  
3. WHEN iterating over branding.brand_values THEN the code SHALL use safe access patterns
4. WHEN using list comprehensions with potentially None collections THEN they SHALL use safe access patterns
5. WHEN calculating metrics from collections THEN the code SHALL handle None collections gracefully

### Requirement 4: Defensive Programming Standards

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the UI code to follow defensive programming principles, so that it remains robust against unexpected data structures and future changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing nested attributes THEN the code SHALL use getattr with safe defaults
2. WHEN performing dictionary operations THEN the code SHALL handle None dictionaries gracefully
3. WHEN joining or processing string collections THEN the code SHALL handle None values appropriately
4. WHEN displaying summary information THEN the code SHALL provide fallback values for missing data

### Requirement 5: Autofix Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the robustness patterns to be compatible with autofix operations, so that code formatting doesn't break the safety mechanisms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autofix formats the code THEN the safe access patterns SHALL remain functionally equivalent
2. WHEN autofix reorganizes imports or structure THEN the robustness logic SHALL be preserved
3. IF autofix changes variable names THEN the safe access patterns SHALL adapt accordingly
4. WHEN autofix runs multiple times THEN the UI SHALL maintain its robustness characteristics

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Error Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Imprint Builder UI to never crash with AttributeError or TypeError, so that I can use all features reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI encounters 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' scenarios THEN it SHALL prevent the error
2. WHEN the UI encounters 'NoneType' object is not iterable scenarios THEN it SHALL prevent the error
3. WHEN the UI encounters missing attributes on data objects THEN it SHALL provide appropriate defaults
4. WHEN the UI performs any data access operation THEN it SHALL be protected against None values

### Requirement 7: Performance and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the robustness patterns to be performant and maintainable, so that they don't impact user experience or code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN safe access patterns are used THEN they SHALL have minimal performance overhead
2. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the robustness patterns SHALL be clear and understandable
3. WHEN new UI components are added THEN they SHALL follow the established safe access patterns
4. WHEN debugging UI issues THEN the safe access patterns SHALL not obscure the root cause

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests that validate UI robustness, so that regressions can be detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN robustness tests are run THEN they SHALL cover all None value scenarios
2. WHEN iteration tests are run THEN they SHALL verify safe access patterns work correctly
3. WHEN UI component tests are run THEN they SHALL validate graceful error handling
4. WHEN regression tests are run THEN they SHALL detect any loss of robustness features

### Requirement 9: Data Structure Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that all objects used by the UI and state management have the required attributes with sensible defaults, so that None errors are completely avoided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI accesses any data object THEN all required attributes SHALL exist with appropriate defaults
2. WHEN state management operations occur THEN all data structures SHALL be validated for completeness
3. WHEN new data objects are created THEN they SHALL follow the established attribute patterns
4. WHEN data objects are passed between components THEN they SHALL maintain their required structure
