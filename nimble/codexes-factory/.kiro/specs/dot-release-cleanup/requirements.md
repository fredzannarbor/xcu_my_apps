# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the file structure cleanup and organization needed for the Codexes Factory platform. The goal is to create a clean, organized directory structure by safely removing temporary files, consolidating scattered files into appropriate directories, and eliminating clutter to improve maintainability and developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Temporary File Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all temporary files that are no longer needed to be safely removed, so that the repository is clean and only contains necessary files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary files are identified THEN they SHALL be safely removed without affecting functionality
2. WHEN file removal is performed THEN a backup or verification process SHALL ensure no critical files are deleted
3. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the repository SHALL contain only necessary files
4. WHEN temporary file patterns are identified THEN they SHALL be added to .gitignore to prevent future accumulation
5. IF files are uncertain THEN they SHALL be moved to a temporary review directory before deletion

### Requirement 2: Test Script Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test scripts to be properly organized in the tests directory, so that testing infrastructure is centralized and easy to find.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test scripts are located THEN they SHALL be moved to the appropriate tests/ subdirectory
2. WHEN test files are moved THEN import paths SHALL be updated to maintain functionality
3. WHEN test organization is complete THEN all tests SHALL be executable from their new locations
4. WHEN test structure is reviewed THEN it SHALL follow standard Python testing conventions
5. IF test dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be preserved during the move

### Requirement 3: Documentation Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all documentation to be centralized in the docs/ directory, so that project documentation is easy to find and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation files are identified THEN they SHALL be moved to appropriate docs/ subdirectories
2. WHEN documentation is moved THEN internal links and references SHALL be updated
3. WHEN documentation structure is complete THEN it SHALL follow a logical hierarchy
4. WHEN README files are processed THEN they SHALL be consolidated or properly organized
5. IF documentation conflicts exist THEN they SHALL be resolved through merging or restructuring

### Requirement 4: Configuration Directory Unification

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all configuration files to be in a single master config directory, so that configuration management is simplified and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN config and configs directories are found THEN they SHALL be merged into a single config/ directory
2. WHEN configuration files are moved THEN application code SHALL be updated to reference the new locations
3. WHEN configuration structure is complete THEN it SHALL follow a logical hierarchy by component or environment
4. WHEN duplicate configurations are found THEN they SHALL be consolidated or clearly differentiated
5. IF configuration conflicts exist THEN they SHALL be resolved while preserving functionality

### Requirement 5: Resource and Export Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want images moved to resources/images and exported files moved to exports/, so that project assets are properly organized and the root directory is clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the images directory is processed THEN its contents SHALL be moved to resources/images/
2. WHEN image files are moved THEN all references in code and documentation SHALL be updated
3. WHEN exported config files are identified THEN they SHALL be moved to exports/ directory
4. WHEN the images directory is empty THEN it SHALL be safely deleted
5. WHEN resource organization is complete THEN the directory structure SHALL be clean and logical
6. IF file references are broken THEN they SHALL be fixed to point to the new locations
