# Nimble LLM Caller Package Requirements

## Overview
Create a standalone, distributable Python package called "nimble-llm-caller" for LLM content generation that can be published to PyPI as a private repository. This package will be used across all Python projects for consistent LLM interactions.

## User Stories

### Core Functionality
- **As a developer**, I want to import a single package that handles all LLM interactions
- **As a developer**, I want to submit multi-model, multi-prompt batch jobs easily
- **As a developer**, I want prompts isolated in JSON data files for maintainability
- **As a developer**, I want model parameters configurable per-model, per-prompt, per-call
- **As a developer**, I want secrets properly obfuscated and managed
- **As a developer**, I want support for reprompting using objects from previous rounds

### Content Generation
- **As a user**, I want results saved to JSON in submission order by default
- **As a user**, I want built-in tools to export results to text, markdown, or LaTeX
- **As a user**, I want automatic assembly of results into final documents
- **As a user**, I want a high-level `llm_get_content` interface that abstracts complexity

### Configuration & Flexibility
- **As a developer**, I want per-model parameter overrides
- **As a developer**, I want per-prompt parameter customization
- **As a developer**, I want per-call parameter adjustments
- **As a developer**, I want consistent error handling and retry logic
- **As a developer**, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies
- Support for major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- JSON handling and validation
- File I/O and path management
- Logging and monitoring

### Compatibility
- Python 3.8+ support
