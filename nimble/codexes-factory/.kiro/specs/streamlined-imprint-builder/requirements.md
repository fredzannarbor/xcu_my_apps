# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current imprint builder UI requires users to input data across many fields, creating a cumbersome experience. This spec redesigns the imprint creation process to be more parsimonious - users provide sketchy input into a single text object, and the system intelligently expands this into a complete imprint strategy with all necessary artifacts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to create a new imprint by providing minimal conceptual input, so that I can quickly establish a publishing brand without extensive configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new imprint THEN the user SHALL provide input through a single text field or document
2. WHEN the user provides sketchy input THEN the system SHALL store this as a structured dictionary
3. WHEN the input is processed THEN the system SHALL use LLM assistance to expand the concept into a complete imprint definition
4. IF the user provides incomplete information THEN the system SHALL make intelligent assumptions based on industry standards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to review and edit the expanded imprint definition before finalization, so that I can ensure it matches my vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system expands the imprint concept THEN it SHALL present a single editable object for user review
2. WHEN the user reviews the definition THEN they SHALL be able to edit all aspects in a unified interface
3. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate consistency across all imprint components
4. IF conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL highlight them and suggest resolutions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want the system to automatically generate all necessary imprint artifacts, so that I can immediately start using the imprint for book production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the imprint definition is finalized THEN the system SHALL generate LaTeX templates for interior and cover
2. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL reflect the imprint's design strategy including fonts, colors, and trim sizes
3. WHEN the imprint is complete THEN it SHALL include custom LLM prompts for content generation
4. IF new codex types are needed THEN the system SHALL provide conceptual definitions for them

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want the system to create a prepress workflow and initial book schedule, so that I can immediately begin production planning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the imprint is created THEN the system SHALL generate a prepress workflow configuration
2. WHEN the workflow is created THEN it SHALL include content assembly and template integration steps
3. WHEN the imprint is finalized THEN the system SHALL create a schedule file with initial book ideas
4. IF the imprint has specific focus areas THEN the book ideas SHALL align with those themes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want the imprint to integrate with existing publishing infrastructure, so that it works seamlessly with the current pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the imprint is created THEN it SHALL be compatible with existing LSI CSV generation
2. WHEN the imprint is used THEN it SHALL work with current field mapping and validation systems
3. WHEN books are processed THEN they SHALL use the imprint's custom prompts and templates
4. IF the imprint has special requirements THEN they SHALL be encoded in the configuration system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want the imprint builder to support both UI and CLI interfaces, so that I can create imprints through my preferred method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the UI THEN the imprint creation SHALL be accessible through a Streamlit interface
2. WHEN using the CLI THEN the imprint creation SHALL be available through command-line tools
3. WHEN either interface is used THEN the underlying process SHALL be identical
4. IF batch creation is needed THEN the CLI SHALL support creating multiple imprints from configuration files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the imprint builder to have comprehensive error handling and validation, so that created imprints are reliable and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input is processed THEN the system SHALL validate all required components are present
2. WHEN templates are generated THEN they SHALL be tested for LaTeX compilation
3. WHEN prompts are created THEN they SHALL be validated for LLM compatibility
4. IF any component fails validation THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and suggestions
