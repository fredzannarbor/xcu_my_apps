# Design Document

## Overview

The streamlined imprint builder transforms the current multi-field configuration process into an intelligent, LLM-assisted workflow. Users provide minimal conceptual input, and the system expands this into a complete imprint strategy with all necessary production artifacts.

## Architecture

### Current Issues Analysis

1. **Complex Multi-Field UI**: Current system requires extensive manual input across dozens of fields
2. **Fragmented Configuration**: Settings scattered across multiple files and interfaces
3. **Manual Template Creation**: Users must manually create LaTeX templates and prompts
4. **No Intelligent Defaults**: System doesn't leverage AI to make smart assumptions
5. **Disconnected Workflow**: Imprint creation separate from production pipeline setup

### Proposed Solution

Create an intelligent imprint builder that:
- Accepts minimal conceptual input from users
- Uses LLM assistance to expand concepts into complete strategies
- Automatically generates all necessary artifacts
- Provides unified editing interface for refinement
- Integrates seamlessly with existing production pipeline

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Imprint Concept Parser

```python
class ImprintConceptParser:
    """
    Parses user input and extracts key imprint concepts.
    Handles various input formats: text descriptions, bullet points, structured data.
    """
    
    def parse_concept(self, user_input: str) -> ImprintConcept:
        # Extract key themes, target audience, design preferences
        # Identify publishing focus areas and specializations
        # Parse any specific requirements or constraints
        pass
    
    def validate_concept(self, concept: ImprintConcept) -> ValidationResult:
        # Check for completeness and consistency
        # Identify missing critical information
        # Suggest areas that need clarification
        pass
```

### 2. Intelligent Imprint Expander

```python
class ImprintExpander:
    """
    Uses LLM assistance to expand minimal concepts into complete imprint strategies.
    Generates comprehensive configurations based on industry best practices.
    """
    
    def expand_concept(self, concept: ImprintConcept) -> ExpandedImprint:
        # Use LLM to generate complete branding strategy
        # Create design specifications (fonts, colors, layouts)
        # Define target audience and market positioning
        # Generate pricing and distribution strategies
        pass
    
    def generate_design_strategy(self, concept: ImprintConcept) -> DesignStrategy:
        # Select appropriate fonts based on genre and audience
        # Choose color palettes that match brand personality
        # Define trim sizes and physical specifications
        # Create visual identity guidelines
        pass
```

### 3. Artifact Generator

```python
class ImprintArtifactGenerator:
    """
    Generates all necessary production artifacts for the imprint.
    Creates templates, prompts, configurations, and workflow definitions.
    """
    
    def generate_latex_templates(self, imprint: ExpandedImprint) -> TemplateSet:
        # Create interior template with custom styling
        # Generate cover template with brand elements
        # Include typography and layout specifications
        # Add imprint-specific design elements
        pass
    
    def generate_llm_prompts(self, imprint: ExpandedImprint) -> PromptSet:
        # Create content generation prompts aligned with imprint focus
        # Generate metadata completion prompts
        # Include style and tone guidelines
        # Add quality control prompts
        pass
    
    def generate_prepress_workflow(self, imprint: ExpandedImprint) -> WorkflowConfig:
        # Define content assembly pipeline
        # Configure template integration steps
        # Set up quality control checkpoints
        # Include error handling procedures
        pass
```

### 4. Schedule Generator

```python
class ImprintScheduleGenerator:
    """
    Creates initial book schedules with ideas aligned to imprint focus.
    Generates publication timeline and content planning.
    """
    
    def generate_initial_schedule(self, imprint: ExpandedImprint) -> BookSchedule:
        # Generate book ideas matching imprint themes
        # Create publication timeline
        # Assign priority levels to different concepts
        # Include market research suggestions
        pass
    
    def suggest_codex_types(self, imprint: ExpandedImprint) -> List[CodexType]:
        # Identify new codex types needed for imprint
        # Define conceptual frameworks for each type
        # Specify content requirements and structures
        # Include production guidelines
        pass
```

### 5. Unified Editor Interface

```python
class ImprintEditor:
    """
    Provides unified interface for editing expanded imprint definitions.
    Supports both UI and programmatic access.
    """
    
    def create_editing_session(self, imprint: ExpandedImprint) -> EditingSession:
        # Create editable representation of all imprint components
        # Enable real-time validation and consistency checking
        # Support undo/redo operations
        # Include preview capabilities
        pass
    
    def validate_changes(self, session: EditingSession) -> ValidationResult:
        # Check consistency across all components
        # Validate template syntax and compilation
        # Test prompt effectiveness
        # Verify configuration completeness
        pass
```
