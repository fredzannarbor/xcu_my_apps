# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Streamlit UI needs to be enhanced to accept and manage all current parameters and configuration files in the Codexes Factory system. The current UI has basic parameter support but lacks comprehensive integration with the multi-level configuration system (default → publisher → imprint → tranche) and many of the advanced LSI and distribution parameters that have been implemented.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Level Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to select and manage configurations at different levels (publisher, imprint, tranche), so that I can apply consistent settings across my publishing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the UI THEN the system SHALL provide dropdowns for selecting publisher, imprint, and tranche configurations
2. WHEN a configuration level is selected THEN the system SHALL load and display the relevant configuration parameters
3. WHEN multiple configuration levels are selected THEN the system SHALL show the inheritance hierarchy (default → publisher → imprint → tranche)
4. WHEN configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which values take precedence

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive LSI Parameter Support

**User Story:** As a metadata specialist, I want access to all LSI parameters through the UI, so that I can configure complete LSI submissions without manual file editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring LSI settings THEN the system SHALL provide UI controls for all LSI fields including territorial pricing, physical specifications, and metadata defaults
2. WHEN LSI parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL validate values against LSI requirements
3. WHEN territorial pricing is configured THEN the system SHALL support all territorial markets with proper currency and pricing multipliers
4. WHEN field overrides are specified THEN the system SHALL allow tranche-level field overrides and exclusions

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Configuration Loading

**User Story:** As a production manager, I want the UI to dynamically load available configurations, so that I can work with any publisher, imprint, or tranche without hardcoded limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI loads THEN the system SHALL scan configuration directories and populate dropdown options
2. WHEN new configuration files are added THEN the system SHALL detect them without requiring UI restart
3. WHEN configuration files are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
4. WHEN configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the UI to reflect changes

### Requirement 4: Advanced Parameter Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want parameters organized in logical groups with expandable sections, so that I can efficiently navigate and configure complex settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing parameters THEN the system SHALL organize them into logical groups (Core Settings, LSI Configuration, Territorial Pricing, etc.)
2. WHEN parameter groups are displayed THEN the system SHALL use expandable sections to manage screen space
3. WHEN parameters have dependencies THEN the system SHALL show/hide related fields dynamically
4. WHEN parameters have help text THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips or help sections

### Requirement 5: Configuration Validation and Preview

**User Story:** As a quality assurance specialist, I want to validate configurations before execution, so that I can catch errors early in the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are modified THEN the system SHALL validate parameters in real-time
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with specific error messages
3. WHEN configurations are complete THEN the system SHALL provide a preview of the final merged configuration
4. WHEN submitting the pipeline THEN the system SHALL perform final validation before execution

### Requirement 6: Enhanced File and Template Management

**User Story:** As a template manager, I want to upload and manage configuration files through the UI, so that I can maintain configurations without direct file system access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing configurations THEN the system SHALL allow uploading new publisher, imprint, and tranche configuration files
2. WHEN configuration files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure and required fields
3. WHEN templates are needed THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable templates for each configuration type
4. WHEN configurations are exported THEN the system SHALL allow downloading current configurations as JSON files

### Requirement 7: Pipeline Integration Enhancement

**User Story:** As a pipeline operator, I want seamless integration between UI configuration and pipeline execution, so that all parameters are properly passed to the book generation process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline is executed THEN the system SHALL pass all UI-configured parameters to the run_book_pipeline.py script
2. WHEN complex configurations are used THEN the system SHALL handle parameter serialization and command-line argument construction
3. WHEN pipeline execution begins THEN the system SHALL display the complete configuration being used
4. WHEN pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL save the configuration used for audit purposes

### Requirement 8: User Experience Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can efficiently configure and execute book production workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design that works on different screen sizes
2. WHEN configurations are complex THEN the system SHALL provide search and filter capabilities for parameters
3. WHEN working with multiple books THEN the system SHALL support batch configuration and execution
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 9: Configuration History and Audit

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to track configuration changes and pipeline executions, so that I can maintain audit trails and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are modified THEN the system SHALL log changes with timestamps and user information
2. WHEN pipelines are executed THEN the system SHALL save complete configuration snapshots
3. WHEN reviewing history THEN the system SHALL provide a configuration history viewer
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL allow comparing configurations between different executions

### Requirement 10: Advanced Features Integration

**User Story:** As a power user, I want access to advanced features like LLM configuration, field mapping strategies, and custom validation rules, so that I can fully utilize the system's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring LLM settings THEN the system SHALL provide UI controls for model selection, retry parameters, and monitoring settings
2. WHEN field mapping is needed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of custom field mapping strategies
3. WHEN validation rules are required THEN the system SHALL support custom validation rule configuration
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide debug modes and detailed logging options
