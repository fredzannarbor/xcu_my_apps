# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI interaction issues in the Streamlit application that are causing runaway loops and preventing proper dropdown refreshes. The current implementation has two major problems: the imprint dropdown doesn't refresh when the publisher changes, and the validation button triggers infinite page rerun loops.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Imprint Dropdown Refresh

**User Story:** As a user, I want the imprint dropdown to automatically refresh and show available imprints when I select a publisher, so that I can properly configure the pipeline without manual page refreshes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "nimble_books" as publisher THEN the imprint dropdown SHALL immediately show "xynapse_traces" as an option
2. WHEN a user changes from one publisher to another THEN the imprint dropdown SHALL clear and repopulate with the new publisher's imprints
3. WHEN the publisher selection changes THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger infinite rerun loops
4. WHEN the imprint dropdown refreshes THEN the tranche dropdown SHALL also refresh to show relevant tranches
5. WHEN no publisher is selected THEN the imprint dropdown SHALL show only an empty option

### Requirement 2: Fix Validation Button Runaway Loop

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the "Validate Only" button to check my configuration without causing the application to enter an infinite refresh loop, so that I can validate my settings safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Validate Only" button THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration exactly once
2. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL display validation results without triggering additional reruns
3. WHEN validation results are shown THEN the page SHALL remain stable and responsive
4. WHEN validation finds errors THEN the system SHALL display them clearly without causing UI instability
5. WHEN validation is successful THEN the system SHALL show success status without page refresh loops

### Requirement 3: Prevent Rerun Loop Cascades

**User Story:** As a user, I want the UI to respond to my interactions smoothly without causing cascading page refreshes that make the application unusable, so that I can work efficiently with the configuration interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any form element changes THEN the system SHALL update only the necessary dependent elements
2. WHEN session state is updated THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger unnecessary reruns
3. WHEN dropdown dependencies change THEN the system SHALL use controlled refresh mechanisms
4. WHEN validation is triggered THEN the system SHALL prevent rerun loops during the validation process
5. WHEN configuration loading occurs THEN the system SHALL debounce rapid successive changes

### Requirement 4: Improve Session State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain consistent state across interactions without losing my selections or causing unexpected behavior, so that my workflow is predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dropdown selections change THEN the system SHALL update session state atomically
2. WHEN publisher changes THEN the system SHALL preserve valid dependent selections where possible
3. WHEN configuration loads THEN the system SHALL maintain UI state consistency
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve form data and user selections
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain stable session state without corruption
