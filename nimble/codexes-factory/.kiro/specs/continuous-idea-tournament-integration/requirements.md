# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec integrates the ContinuousIdeaGenerator and Tournament system from the integrate_ideas directory with synthetic reader feedback capabilities into the codexes-factory platform. The system will provide 24/7 automated idea generation, competitive evaluation through tournaments, and synthetic reader feedback integration to feed winners into the book production pipeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want a continuous idea generation system that runs 24/7, so that I always have a pipeline of fresh book concepts being evaluated and refined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the continuous idea generator is started THEN it SHALL generate batches of book ideas at configurable intervals
2. WHEN ideas are generated THEN they SHALL be automatically fed into tournament evaluation
3. WHEN tournaments complete THEN winning ideas SHALL be promoted to the book production pipeline
4. IF the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL log them and continue operation with fallback strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want tournament-based idea evaluation, so that only the most promising concepts advance to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient ideas are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create tournament brackets
2. WHEN tournaments run THEN they SHALL use LLM-based evaluation to determine winners
3. WHEN tournaments complete THEN results SHALL be saved with detailed match data and reasoning
4. IF tournaments have insufficient participants THEN the system SHALL use bye rounds or wait for more ideas

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want synthetic reader feedback integration, so that ideas are evaluated from multiple reader perspectives before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ideas advance from tournaments THEN they SHALL be evaluated by synthetic reader panels
2. WHEN synthetic readers evaluate ideas THEN they SHALL provide feedback on market appeal, genre fit, and audience targeting
3. WHEN reader feedback is collected THEN it SHALL be synthesized into actionable insights for ideation, editing, and imprint strategies
4. IF reader feedback is negative THEN ideas SHALL be either refined or rejected before production

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want the ideation system integrated with the existing Streamlit UI, so that I can monitor and control the process through the web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Ideation page THEN users SHALL see real-time status of idea generation and tournaments
2. WHEN viewing the interface THEN users SHALL be able to start/stop continuous generation and configure parameters
3. WHEN tournaments complete THEN users SHALL be able to review results and manually promote ideas
4. IF manual intervention is needed THEN users SHALL be able to override automatic decisions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want winning ideas automatically integrated with the book pipeline, so that promising concepts move seamlessly into production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tournament winners are selected THEN they SHALL be automatically added to imprint schedules
2. WHEN ideas are promoted THEN they SHALL be formatted as proper book metadata for the production pipeline
3. WHEN schedule integration occurs THEN it SHALL respect imprint-specific themes and requirements
4. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL queue ideas for manual review and processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want synthetic reader feedback to improve the overall publishing strategy, so that insights inform ideation, editing, and imprint development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reader feedback is collected THEN it SHALL be analyzed for patterns and trends
2. WHEN patterns are identified THEN they SHALL be used to refine idea generation prompts
3. WHEN feedback indicates editing needs THEN it SHALL be integrated into the editing workflow
4. IF feedback suggests new imprint opportunities THEN it SHALL be flagged for imprint strategy review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have comprehensive monitoring and error handling, so that it operates reliably in a 24/7 environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL log all operations with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full context and stack traces
3. WHEN system health degrades THEN it SHALL send alerts and attempt automatic recovery
4. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully and preserve data integrity
