# Barcode Format Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The current barcode implementation has several critical issues that prevent proper display on book covers and compliance with US book industry standards. The barcode is not appearing correctly on covers and lacks the standard formatting expected for retail book sales.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standard US Book Barcode Format

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want barcodes to follow standard US book industry formatting, so that books can be properly scanned and sold in retail environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a barcode THEN the system SHALL create a proper UPC-A barcode from ISBN-13
2. WHEN displaying the barcode THEN the system SHALL include formatted ISBN text below the barcode
3. WHEN creating the barcode layout THEN the system SHALL include an optional price block area next to the main barcode
4. WHEN formatting the ISBN text THEN the system SHALL display it as "ISBN 978-X-XXXXX-XX-X" format
5. WHEN positioning elements THEN the system SHALL follow GS1 standards for barcode layout and spacing

### Requirement 2: Proper Cover Positioning

**User Story:** As a designer, I want barcodes to appear in the correct location on the back cover, so that they are visible and scannable without interfering with other design elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating barcode position THEN the system SHALL place it in the bottom-right corner of the back cover
2. WHEN positioning the barcode THEN the system SHALL maintain proper safety margins from cover edges
3. WHEN integrating with cover layout THEN the system SHALL ensure barcode doesn't overlap with back cover text
4. WHEN calculating coordinates THEN the system SHALL account for spine width and cover dimensions correctly
5. WHEN validating placement THEN the system SHALL ensure barcode remains within the trim area

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Barcode Generation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the barcode generation to be robust and compliant, so that all generated books meet industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating UPC-A barcodes THEN the system SHALL convert ISBN-13 properly by removing 978/979 prefix
2. WHEN creating barcode images THEN the system SHALL use appropriate resolution and dimensions for printing
3. WHEN validating barcodes THEN the system SHALL verify check digits and format compliance
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful fallbacks and error messages
5. WHEN integrating with templates THEN the system SHALL generate proper LaTeX code for barcode placement

### Requirement 4: Price Block Integration

**User Story:** As a retailer, I want books to have proper price block areas on barcodes, so that pricing information can be added when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating barcode layout THEN the system SHALL include a designated price block area
2. WHEN positioning price block THEN the system SHALL place it adjacent to the main barcode
3. WHEN formatting price area THEN the system SHALL follow standard dimensions and spacing
4. WHEN price is not specified THEN the system SHALL leave the price block empty but properly formatted
5. WHEN integrating layout THEN the system SHALL ensure price block doesn't interfere with other cover elements
