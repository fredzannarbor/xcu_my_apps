# Configuration Synchronization Fix Requirements

## Introduction

The Book Pipeline interface has a disconnect between the Configuration Selection (outside the form) and the Core Settings (inside the form). Users select a publisher and imprint in the configuration section, but these values don't populate the corresponding fields in the core settings, causing validation errors for required fields that should be automatically filled.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration to Core Settings Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the publisher and imprint I select in the Configuration Selection to automatically populate the corresponding fields in Core Settings, so that I don't get validation errors for fields that should be pre-filled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a publisher in the Configuration Selection THEN the publisher field in Core Settings SHALL be automatically populated with the same value
2. WHEN a user selects an imprint in the Configuration Selection THEN the imprint field in Core Settings SHALL be automatically populated with the same value
3. WHEN a user clicks the refresh button in Configuration Selection THEN any updated publisher/imprint values SHALL be synchronized to Core Settings
4. WHEN the Configuration Selection values are synchronized to Core Settings THEN the validation SHALL pass for these required fields
5. WHEN a user manually changes the publisher or imprint in Core Settings THEN it SHALL override the Configuration Selection values for that session

### Requirement 2: Default Value Population

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Core Settings to show meaningful default values based on my configuration selection, so that I can see what values will be used without having to guess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads with no configuration selected THEN the Core Settings publisher and imprint fields SHALL show placeholder text indicating they will be populated from configuration
2. WHEN a valid publisher and imprint are selected in Configuration Selection THEN the Core Settings SHALL immediately reflect these values
3. WHEN the configuration selection is cleared or reset THEN the Core Settings SHALL revert to empty/placeholder state
4. WHEN configuration values are populated THEN they SHALL be visually distinct from user-entered values (e.g., with helper text indicating "from configuration")

### Requirement 3: Validation Logic Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the validation to recognize when required fields are populated from configuration selection, so that I don't see false validation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN publisher and imprint are populated from Configuration Selection THEN validation SHALL treat these as valid required field values
2. WHEN validation runs THEN it SHALL check both the Core Settings form values AND the Configuration Selection values for required fields
3. WHEN a required field is empty in Core Settings but populated in Configuration Selection THEN validation SHALL pass for that field
4. WHEN validation displays results THEN it SHALL clearly indicate which values came from configuration vs. user input
5. WHEN validation fails THEN error messages SHALL provide clear guidance on whether to fix the issue in Configuration Selection or Core Settings

### Requirement 4: User Experience Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear understanding of how Configuration Selection and Core Settings work together, so that I can efficiently configure the pipeline without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the interface THEN there SHALL be clear visual indicators showing which Core Settings values are populated from Configuration Selection
2. WHEN I change a value in Configuration Selection THEN any affected Core Settings SHALL update immediately with visual feedback
3. WHEN I manually override a Core Settings value THEN there SHALL be a clear indication that this value is now independent of Configuration Selection
4. WHEN I hover over auto-populated fields THEN tooltips SHALL explain that these values come from Configuration Selection
5. WHEN validation runs THEN the results SHALL clearly distinguish between configuration-derived and user-entered values

### Requirement 5: State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper state synchronization between Configuration Selection and Core Settings, so that the interface behaves predictably and maintains data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Configuration Selection values change THEN the session state SHALL be updated to reflect the new values
2. WHEN Core Settings form is rendered THEN it SHALL pull default values from the current Configuration Selection state
3. WHEN a user manually overrides a Core Settings value THEN the override state SHALL be tracked separately from configuration defaults
4. WHEN the page refreshes or reloads THEN the synchronization between Configuration Selection and Core Settings SHALL be restored
5. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each user's configuration state SHALL be maintained independently

## Success Criteria

- Users can select publisher/imprint in Configuration Selection and see these values automatically appear in Core Settings
- Validation passes when required fields are populated from Configuration Selection
- Clear visual distinction between configuration-derived and user-entered values
- No false validation errors for fields that should be auto-populated
- Smooth, intuitive user experience with immediate feedback on configuration changes

## Technical Considerations

- Configuration Selection is outside the main form, Core Settings are inside the form
- Session state management needs to bridge the gap between these two sections
- Validation logic needs to consider both configuration and form values
- Real-time synchronization without causing form submission or page refresh
- Backward compatibility with existing configuration workflows
