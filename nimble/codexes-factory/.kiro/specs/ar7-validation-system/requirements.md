# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for validating the concept to manuscript publishing system, including the imprint configuration, pipeline tools, prompts file, book metadata, and pipeline integration. The system must ensure that all components work together seamlessly and without conflicting configuration options.  As an example:

Concept: mock IPCC AR7 report (20 chapters)
- Imprint: Climate Science Reports / imprints directory name: csr
- {Pipeline Tools}: imprint/csr/
                    prepress.py
                    interior_template.tex
                    cover_template.tex
                    AR7_prompts.json
                    csr_schedule.csv
                    book_metadata.json
                    *any other files needed for the pipeline to run successfully.



## Requirements

### Requirement 0: Code Reuse and Efficiency

As a developer, I do not want to proliferate excess redundant scripts, classes, and methods.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. The system MUST re-use existing codes and classes WHEN they already exist.
2. The system MUST maintain backward compatibility and not break existing functionality.
3. The system MUST be efficient and not unnecessarily complex.
4. The system MUST be well-documented and easy to understand.
5. The system MUST be scalable and maintainable.

### Requirement 0: Pipeline Tools Availability, Creation, and Customization

**User Story:** As a publishing system administrator, I want to validate that all the needed tools are available to take the concept through the pipeline to completed book, so that the AR7 climate report can be produced without missing dependencies.


#### Acceptance Criteria


1. WHEN a user provides a book concept THEN the system SHALL assess whether the concept can be handled by the default or another existing imprint.
2. WHEN a new imprint is needed THEN the system SHALL create it using the imprint builder methods found via 9_Imprint_Builder.py.  The system SHALL create Imprint and ImprintBuilder classes if they do not already exist.
3. WHEN a new or existing imprint is selected THEN the system SHALL validate it has access to all required {Pipeline Tools}.
4. IF the imprint lacks any required tools THEN the system SHALL report specific missing components and BUILD them.
5.  Each missing component will need a corresponding builder tool or prompt that accepts the default pipeline tool files (found in imprints/default) and transforms them into imprint-specific versions to be stored in imprints/NewImprint/...

### Requirement 1:

**User Story:** I want to be able to create new imprints on the fly.

### Requirement 2:

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want to be able to design new book types --CodexTypes-- to meet the needs of readers of new imprints. Example: pilsa book template with matching verso/recto pages for presenting quotations and transcriptive meditation.

### Requirement 3:

**User Story:** As a publisher, I want the program to establish visual design style & requirements for the imprint.
