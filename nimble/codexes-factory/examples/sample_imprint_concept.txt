A literary imprint focused on contemporary fiction for young adults, emphasizing diverse voices and social issues. We want a modern, accessible brand that connects with readers aged 16-25 through social media and book clubs. Our mission is to publish 8-12 high-quality titles per year that address important social themes while maintaining commercial appeal. We're particularly interested in stories from underrepresented communities and first-time authors. The imprint should have a fresh, vibrant visual identity that stands out in the crowded YA market while maintaining literary credibility.
