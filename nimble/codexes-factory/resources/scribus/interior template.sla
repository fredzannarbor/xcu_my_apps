Each section is 25 feet by 7.5 feet, except for the waterline ones, which are only 25 feet by 3.5 feet. The target usually consists of waterline, lower deck, main deck and upper deck sections.\n\nOf these, about sixteen sections can be effectively attacked by an A gun firing A.P. Seven of them cannot be penetrated, and it is no use hitting the remainder with A.P. The really vulnerable area is therefore 10 out of 100, or approximately 1 in 4.\n\nWith 0-inch A.P., the vulnerable area is about 3 in 60, which means that the chances of actually hitting something are so small that it is not worth firing 0-inch A.P.\n\n6-inch guns must therefore fire H.E. and hope for lucky hits.&quot;,"/>
