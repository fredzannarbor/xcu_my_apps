Nimitz, and through the gritty hard work of four loyal and \nearnest Chief Petty Officers (CPOs) on his staff, who at times resorted to less than \ncompletely honest methods to acquire the scarce materials and assistance needed \nto build the base in this remote paradise.3 \nSubmarine Division 14, consisting of 10 R-class submarines, calls the base \nhome.\nclass \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n108 \n108 \nRobinson \nRevie O. \nFireman 3rd class \nRoper \nClifford H. \nLieutenant\n\nTN(SS) Ric Hedman, USN—August 2021 \n \n \n \n A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND \n \n \nxix \n \nABBREVIATIONS \nBQ \nBethlehem Quincy \nCO \nCommanding Officer \nCOB \n\nclass \nVerano \nLorenzo \nMess Attendant 2nd class \nWaldron \nRaymond W. \nElectrician 1st class (Radio)\nclass \nClendenny \nJesse L. \nFireman 3rd class \nDew \nJohn W. \nQuartermaster 2nd\n\nIt is very important to understand that the only way that a fuel leak could have \nbeen the root cause of the incident would have been if the initial amount of fuel \nonboard had actually been 6,978 gallons, and when combined with the 3,318 gal-\nlons that they took onboard at the fuel pier, the total amount of fuel onboard when \nthey left the fuel pier and headed to sea was 10,296 gallons.\n\ners that interviewed the crew upon arrival in Hilo reported that the crew could \nnot account for how they ran dry.22 If the crew was surprised by running out of \nfuel, then the only way to explain it was that either there was a previously un-\nknown leak in one or more of the tanks, or that they believed they had more fuel \nonboard then they actually had when they went to the fuel pier in Pearl Harbor.\n \n \nA GOOD AND \nFAVORABLE WIND \nTHE UNUSUAL STORY OF  \nA SUBMARINE UNDER SAIL \nAND ITS CAUTIONARY LESSONS \n FOR THE MODERN NAVY \n \nDAVID L.

A submarine under his command had been hazarded at sea and Naval \nRegulations required him to conduct an investigation.\nThere was also a capacity of 8,880 gallons that could be carried in addition to the \nnormal and reserve amounts, but this amount had to be carried in the ballast \ntanks, rendering the boat incapable of submerging until it was used up and the \ntanks cleared; the concept of the fuel ballast tank had not yet been implemented \nin the USN.\n\n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n50 \n50 \n“But how…”, Douglas pauses, calming his thoughts and holding up his hand to \nstave off a reply from Gallemore, realizing that pursuing blame at this point is \nuseless.\nThe R-class submarines \nwere billeted for three officers and twenty-seven enlisted.28 However, \nthis obscures the fact that the officers would have been “multi-hatted” \nduring their tour aboard, filling multiple collateral duties as required by \nNaval Regulations.\n\nH. I. Sutton \nNaval analyst, “Covert Shores\" \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \nx \n \nx \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nPREFACE \nThere are stories of the sea that involve bravery, perseverance, innovation, ad-\naptation, and strength of character.\nThe subsequent trial found him guilty of “neglect of duty”, but taking into \naccount the poor state of the charts for the Batangas area and Nimitz’s prior spot-\nless record, he was sentenced only to a public reprimand by the local area com-\nmander, who decided that the proceedings themselves constituted a public repri-\nmand and thus no further action was taken against Nimitz.\nGiven that infor-\nmation, for a ten-day underway, it is determined that a trip to the fuel dock will \nbe necessary to take on additional fuel.6 \nHaving been in port for several weeks, there is little food on board any of the \nboats.\n\n \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n56 \n56 \n12 MAY 1921, RIGGING SAILS \nDouglas finds Waldron and the two of them head to the aft port corner of the \nnearly dark control room, a handheld lantern lighting the way.\n\nThere are three main purposes to this work: 1) to tell a great and entertaining \nsea story; 2) to provide an analysis of the events to the reader so that they may \nunderstand what happened and why; and 3) to provide lessons learned to the pre-\nsent-day Navy in leadership, perseverance, and innovative thinking.\n\n \n \n \n \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n110 \n110 \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nOFFICIAL U.S. NAVY DOCUMENTS \nLog Book, U.S.S. R-14, Jan. 1, 1921 to Dec. 31,1921, pp.\n\nHis awards include the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal, \nNavy Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary and Service \nMedals, Armed Forces Reserve Medal w/ “M” device, and a COMSUBGRU 7 Letter \nof Commendation.\nIt was intended to provide the relatively small R-boats with the bunkerage \nneeded to cross the Atlantic under their own power, a lesson learned from the deployment \nof the E, K and L-class submarines to Ireland and the Azores during World War I. This and the \nfollowing two reproductions of the original notebook were supplied to the authors by histo-\nrian and author Jim Christley.\nA \nvalued member of the Naval Academy fencing team (a sporting interest he shares \nwith Douglas), Gallemore maintains an athletic physique but conversely has a \nreputation of being quite the chow hound, renowned for his ability to eat all that \nis in front of him, in part earning him the nickname “Beanie” at the Academy.\n\nLastly, to Alexander Dean Douglas, Roy Trent Gallemore, Harry Woodworth, \nand the entire 1921 crew of the R-14, Ric and I would like to express our admiration \nand gratitude for the lessons in perseverance, innovative thinking, and seaman-\nship.\nThis required them \nto multi-task at a very high level, a situation that is difficult to manage \neven by early 21st century standards, where highly educated officers have \na myriad of automatic systems to assist them, and outright problematic in \n1921.\nThe senior petty officers did not properly supervise \nthe junior personnel, the chief petty officers did not fully inculcate professional-\nism and the need to follow regulations and procedures, and Douglas and Galle-\nmore did not instill and emphasize the proper command climate, a climate that \npromotes attention to detail and procedural compliance.\nThese positions included Commanding Officer, Exec-\nutive Officer, Navigator, Communications Officer, Engineering Officer, \nGunnery Officer, Commissary Officer, and First Lieutenant.29 The Com-\nmanding Officer by himself has a long list of duties and responsibilities \nand was typically not assigned any other collateral duties.\nAddi-\ntional information on how the sails were made and rigged came not only from the logs, but from \na clipping from a Navy publication (the title is not indicated on the clipping), written by Journal-\nist Chief Petty Officer E.J. Jeffrey, USN in the early 1950’s, and forwarded to the authors by Bruce \nGallemore, grandson of Roy Trent Gallemore.\n\nRealizing that both Douglas and Gallemore needed further guidance before being \nfully ready for command, yet still needing Clarke on his staff, Nimitz got orders \nwritten to transfer Lieutenant Clifford H. Roper from command of the R-13 (SS-\n90) to the R-14.\nRaymond W. Waldron fires up the radio \ndown below in the control room, but reports that due to several hard to trace float-\ning grounds in the set, he can’t verify that the message went out, and regardless \nhe did not receive a reply.12 \nBy 4:00 a.m.\n\nMost naval vessels gave up sails and the associated rigging over 20 years prior, \nbut Sailmaker’s Mate was still an established enlisted rate,15 and Woodworth des-\nperately wishes he has one of those specialists aboard as he gathers the needed \nequipment.\nDouglas and \nGallemore’s experience level was such that they handled the routine in-\nand-out training operations around Hawaii in fine fashion, and this gave \nClarke and Nimitz the confidence needed to allow them to handle the \nsearch and rescue operation on their own.\nWith \nthe switchboards and generators lined up for a battery charge, the rotating arma-\ntures in each generator provide enough current to maintain the batteries and \nmake up for any power loss to lighting and cooking, as long as that use is kept to a \nminimum.\nThe authors \nhave no doubt that Nimitz actually did so, but in conducting research, it was de-\ntermined that the National Archives had no record of any such proceedings on file, \nand it is not mentioned at all in E.B. Potter’s highly regarded 1976 biography Nim-\nitz.\n\n75 pounds of fresh beef \n42 pounds of apples  \n75 pounds fresh oranges  \n45 pounds of bacon  \n2 pounds of string beans  \n100 pounds of wheat

had a fuel leak, then the boat would \nhave run dry at some time on the 6th day, not the 10th.\nBased on the information in the previous day’s logs, the process stops \nwhen 3318 gallons of fuel is received, the crew confident that that they now have \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n22 \n22 \n10,296 gallons of fuel onboard.\nOnly under these condi-\ntions is it reasonable to speculate that during the course of the period at sea a hole \nor a gapped seam in one or more tanks led to the fuel leaking out and caused the \nboat to run dry, given the fact that the boat ran out of fuel on the 10th day.\nThe R-class boats have a normal and reserve fuel ca-\npacity of 10,383 gallons, spread out over seven fuel tanks located under the walk-\ning decks in the torpedo and engine rooms.5 The ship’s logs indicate that she has \n6,978 gallons currently onboard.\n\n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n86 \n86 \npointed out above, the crew clearly believed that they had 6,978 gallons of fuel \nonboard when they arrived at the fuel pier.\n\nSo, with 7,588 gallons on board when they got underway, and with an average \nusage of 840 gallons a day, it should have been blindingly apparent to anyone that \nthe boat was headed to sea without enough fuel onboard to complete a 10-day mission.\n\n \n \n A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND \n \n \n \n49 \n \n11 MAY 1921, 9:15 P.M. “HOIST WITH OUR \nOWN PETARD” 9 \nA

would also be found in the day-to-day hand-\nwritten logs.\nIn their hurry to get the underway preparations com-\npleted, they may have been overzealous in the procedure, resulting in not only the \ncompensation water being blown overboard, but the fuel as well, specifically the \nfuel in reserve tanks #1 and 7.\n82 \nProcedural Compliance

\nbeen published by the Naval Submarine League in The Submarine Review.\n\nJust twenty minutes later, at 6:10, the engine room calls up again and reports \nthat they had to shut down the starboard engine because they were “unable to get \nsufficient fuel.”\nAs indicated in \nPart One, after receiving the orders to get underway and search for the Conestoga, \nthe R-14 went to the fuel pier and took on 3,318 gallons, for a total prior to getting \nunderway of 7,588 gallons.\nThe crew comes topside through deck hatches and \nform a line from the stack of provisions on the pier to the hatch

\n \n17-31 MAY 1921, SUBMARINE BASE PEARL \nHARBOR, T.H. \n\n\nFor instance, on the day the R-14 arrived in Hilo, at the top of the log page where it \nshould have been labeled as “Log of the United States Ship R-14” the typist put \ndown R-12.\nIf they answered in the affirmative and \ncould show that proper procedure had been followed, then the initial amount of \nfuel recorded in the official typed log on 02 May would have been the previously \nmentioned 6,978 gallons, not the 4,270 gallons that was actually recorded.\nOne of Henry Ford’s “Eagle” \npatrol craft, the Eagle No. 14 was part of a wartime emergency shipbuilding pro-\ngram designed to quickly get craft into the water to fight off the scourge of the \nGerman U-boats.\n\n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n34 \n34 \nSince the submarine is on the surface only three men need to be on watch in \nthe control room.\nRecorded performance data shows that given the \nconditions in which the R-14 is expected to be steaming, she will use about 840 \ngallons of fuel each day; 10,296 gallons should provide them at least a 19% safety \nmargin.\n\nClearly, the crew believed they had 6,978 gallons on board when they arrived at \nthe fuel pier, but they did not, and this is most likely to due to poor record-keep-\ning.\nLiterally walking down the pier from one boat to the next, he \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n96 \n96 \nwould take over the R-14 until such a time as both Roper and Nimitz were satisfied \nthat Douglas and Gallemore were ready to move up.\nIn Part One we speculated on a scenario in which prior to heading to the fuel \npier a hurried Chief Graham and Lieutenant Gallemore blindly trusted the infor-\nmation that was in the existing hand-written logs and no attempt was made to \nsound the tanks to empirically determine their levels.\nDouglas receives status \nreports on all equipment, gets updates on the boat’s course, speed, and current \n A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND \n \n \n \n27 \nposition, and chats with the lookouts as to the status of all contacts, which in this \ncase there are none.\n\n A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND \n \n \nxvii \nNoted historian Jim Christley provided background information on the tech-\nnical aspects of the R-class submarines and his willing assistance is greatly appre-\nciated.\n\nNEWSPAPER ARTICLES \n“Officials Give Up Conestoga, Naval Tug, As Lost”, The New York Times, June 22, \n1921.\nIf the crew is not \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n36 \n36 \ndiligent in this task, water can be ingested into the engines, a potentially disas-\ntrous situation.\n\n \n A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND \n \n \n \n59 \n12-15 MAY 1921, UNDERWAY ON WIND POWER \nChief Hearne suggests a method of conducting a low-power trickle charge on \nthe battery.\nThe boat and her \ncrew arrived at the submarine base in New London, CT, in February 1931, and for \nthe next ten years, they conducted training missions for students at the Subma-\nrine School.\nThis was obviously \n A GOOD AND FAVORABLE WIND \n \n \n91 \nnot possible with only two men, and thus they were forced to improvise a \nwatch schedule that would keep one of them on duty at all times but still \nallow adequate rest.\n\n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n2 \n2 \nof the ships actually stationed at the base consisted of patrol craft, auxiliaries and \nyard craft, and a contingent of the Pacific Fleet’s submarines.\n\n \n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n80 \n80 \nHOW AND WHY \nRunning out of fuel at sea is an extremely rare occurrence in the Navy.\n\nAs noted, there were numerous instances in which a lack of leadership and \noversight occurred during the month of May, 1921, aboard the R-14, specifically \nrelated to running out of fuel.\nNot yet \nfully trained or fully qualified, they may have misinterpreted what they saw when \nlooking into their bucket, thinking they saw fuel oil but in fact it was only oily \nwater.\n\n JOHNSTON & HEDMAN \n \n \n16 \n16 \nsubmarines plus the Eagle No. 14 means a lot of food needs to be received and dis-\ntributed.\nAt \neleven o’clock preparations are complete and Nimitz issues orders to submarines \nunder his command to prepare to get under way for a ten-day deployment to \nsearch for the missing Conestoga, beginning no later than sunset that same day.\n\nMAGAZINE ARTICLES AND MONOGRAPHS \n“R-14 Under Way, Under Sail”, Robert G. Douglas, Naval History Magazine, August, \n2004.\nWhen exposed to the sub-tropical, idyllic “paradise” of beau-\ntiful Hawaii with its peaceful and uncomplicated environment and com-\nparatively permissive morality, people of highly driven, goal-oriented, \npressure-cooker cultures can develop a type of mental malaise.\n\nDue to a shortage of qualified officers at this remote duty station, the boat’s official \nCO, Lieutenant Vincent A. Clarke, Jr., has been pulled away for temporary duty as \nthe Engineering Officer for SUBDIV 14.",
