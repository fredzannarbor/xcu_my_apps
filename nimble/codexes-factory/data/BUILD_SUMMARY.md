### Build Statistics

- **Build Time:** ~5 minutes
- **Images Converted:** 200+ TIF to JPG conversions
- **PDF Size:** 505.29 MB (high-resolution images)
- **Success Rate:** 100% - all photos included and captioned

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks

✅ All 347 photos included in PDF
✅ All photos have matching captions
✅ Chapter text properly formatted
✅ Table of contents generated
✅ Page numbers correct
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Images display at appropriate size
✅ PDF opens without errors

### Known Notes

1. **Photo Count Variance:** Initial estimate was 155 photos, but actual count is 347 due to:
   - Multiple variants of some photos (labeled with 'b', 'c' suffixes)
   - More comprehensive photo collection than initially documented
   - All photos from source directories included to ensure complete coverage

2. **Chapter 6:** No Chapter 6 exists in the source materials (chapters go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)

3. **File Size:** PDF is 505 MB due to high-resolution historical photographs - suitable for print production

## Historical Significance

This book documents the crucial role of the Elco Naval Division in World War II through:

- **Manufacturing Excellence:** Details of building 399 PT boats during WWII
- **Personal Stories:** Artifacts and memories from workers and sailors
- **Technical Innovation:** Evolution from 70-foot to 80-foot designs
- **Historical Photos:** Rare images of the Bayonne, NJ facility and boat construction
- **Human Element:** Stories of the workers who built these vessels and the sailors who served on them

The Elco Naval Division in Bayonne, New Jersey was the largest manufacturer of American PT boats, and this book preserves that legacy through comprehensive photographic documentation and detailed historical narrative.
