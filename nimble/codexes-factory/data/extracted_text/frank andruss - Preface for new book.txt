It is hard to believe that this is my 5th book that deals with the World War Two PT Boats. I never intended to continue producing the books, but somehow my passion just took over.

With this new book I am delighted having come across so many new and unpublished photos. Elco was the front runner in PT Boat production during the war years and did an incredible job of documenting their boats, both on film and video. In doing this book it is my intention to help educate the public about not only the role of the Elco PT Boat, but the workers and management that lived the war years producing them.

Running 24 hours a day, the workmanship in building these wooden boats was incredible. Nothing left the plant unless it was 100%, a true testament to the people that built them. During the war the plant at Elco would receive the Army/Navy E award for excellence 6 times. It is in these photos that the book comes alive, as you will see first hand the many stages of assembly.

I firmly believe that to tell a story, one needs to see photos and not just a mass of text. Here, you will see history first hand in photos as well as chapters, that explain everything dealing with the history of these fine boats. During the war these little Midget Sluggers were on the front lines in all theaters of war, taking the fight to the enemy and proving their worth, not only as torpedo boats, but later as gunboats making the Elco PT as dangerous foe.

It is my hope that you the reader will become educated as to the Elco Naval Division in Bayonne, New Jersey and her fine history.
