audience alignment score.\n\n8.  **`else` block:**\n    *   If the book genre is not \"Educational Fiction\" or \"Contemporary Children's Book\", the function returns a dictionary containing the market appeal score, genre fit score and audience alignment score.\n\n9.  **`return { ... }`:**\n    *   If the analysis is successful, the function returns a JSON object containing the book idea, summary, genre, and target audience.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Genre Fit:** The genre fit score is a crucial factor in determining the book's appeal. It should be based on the book's content and the target audience's understanding of the genre.\n*   **Market Appeal Score:** The market appeal score is a measure of how appealing the book is to readers.
