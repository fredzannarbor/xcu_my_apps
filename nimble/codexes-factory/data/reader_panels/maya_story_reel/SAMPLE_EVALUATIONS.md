# Sample Purchasing Evaluations - Maya's Story Reel

This document provides representative evaluation samples from each of the four purchasing decision maker types.

---

## Sample 1: Elementary Principal Evaluation

**Persona:** Principal Peterson #1  
**Overall Rating:** 8.0/10

### Scores
- Market Appeal: 7/10
- Genre Fit: 8/10
- Audience Alignment: 9/10

### Detailed Feedback

As an elementary principal balancing budgets and parent satisfaction, Maya's Story Reel addresses a critical need: engaging struggling readers while supporting evidence-based literacy instruction. The Science of Reading alignment is particularly valuable given our district's recent adoption of structured literacy approaches.

**ROI Perspective:** This book could serve multiple functions - classroom read-aloud, intervention support material, and parent engagement tool. The AI integration makes it contemporary and relevant to students' digital lives, which could increase engagement rates. If we see even a 10% improvement in reading attitudes among our struggling readers, the investment would be justified.

**Implementation Concerns:** The book's effectiveness will depend heavily on teacher facilitation. We'd need professional development to help teachers use this as a bridge to phonics instruction rather than a standalone solution. The AI theme might also require parent communication to address concerns about screen time and AI in education.

**Budget Considerations:** At typical bulk pricing ($8-12 per copy), outfitting 3-4 classrooms would cost $600-1000. This is reasonable for a pilot program, especially if we can track reading growth data for participating students.

### Top Recommendations
1. Include a teacher's guide with discussion questions aligned to reading standards
2. Provide parent handouts explaining Science of Reading concepts referenced in the book
3. Add assessment tools to measure changes in reading attitudes and phonics knowledge
4. Create connections to existing phonics programs we've already purchased
5. Consider an audio version for struggling readers to build fluency

### Key Concerns
1. Will require teacher training to maximize educational value
2. AI theme may trigger parent concerns requiring proactive communication
3. Need evidence this translates to measurable reading gains, not just engagement
4. Sustainability - is this a one-time purchase or part of ongoing series?
5. Integration with existing literacy curriculum may require planning time

## Sample 2: Curriculum Director Evaluation

**Persona:** Curriculum Director Chen #3  
**Overall Rating:** 7.67/10

### Scores
- Market Appeal: 6/10
- Genre Fit: 9/10
- Audience Alignment: 8/10

### Detailed Feedback

From a curriculum perspective, Maya's Story Reel demonstrates strong alignment with evidence-based literacy instruction and contemporary learning theory. The explicit focus on Science of Reading principles makes this a valuable supplementary resource for our structured literacy adoption.

**Standards Alignment:** The book addresses multiple Common Core standards - phonics development (RF.4.3), comprehension strategies (RL.4.1), and growth mindset themes align with SEL standards. The emotional regulation and self-awareness components support our district's social-emotional learning initiatives.

**Evidence-Based Concerns:** While the concept is sound - using relatable narratives to teach phonics - we need research backing the effectiveness of fiction-based phonics instruction versus systematic phonics programs. The book works better as a motivational tool than a primary instructional resource.

**Scalability Assessment:** District-wide adoption would require significant investment ($50,000+ for 5,000 students) with unclear ROI compared to proven phonics programs. However, targeted use for intervention groups or reluctant readers could be highly effective. Recommend pilot study with 200-300 students across demographic groups, measuring reading attitudes, phonics knowledge, and engagement metrics before broader adoption.

**Implementation Complexity:** Moderate. Requires alignment meetings with reading specialists, parent communication protocols, and teacher professional development. Timeline: 6-9 months for effective rollout.

### Top Recommendations
1. Conduct controlled pilot study measuring reading attitudes and phonics application
2. Develop pacing guides showing how this supplements core phonics instruction
3. Create professional development modules for teachers on facilitating discussions
4. Align vocabulary and phonics patterns to district scope and sequence
5. Establish data collection protocols to measure impact on reading benchmarks
6. Partner with reading specialists to create intervention protocols using the book

### Key Concerns
1. Lack of empirical research on effectiveness of this specific approach
2. High cost for district-wide adoption without proven evidence base
3. May divert resources from systematic phonics programs with stronger research backing
4. Technology integration (AI theme) requires equity considerations for low-tech families
5. Sustainability concerns - is publisher committed to ongoing support and updates?
6. Fidelity monitoring - how do we ensure consistent implementation across schools?

## Sample 3: School Librarian Evaluation

**Persona:** Librarian Linda #7  
**Overall Rating:** 8.67/10

### Scores
- Market Appeal: 9/10
- Genre Fit: 8/10
- Audience Alignment: 9/10

### Detailed Feedback

As a librarian focused on reading engagement and building diverse collections, Maya's Story Reel is exactly the kind of contemporary, relatable story that struggling readers need. The combination of AI technology, creative expression, and literacy challenges creates multiple entry points for students who might otherwise avoid books.

**Collection Development Value:** This fills a critical gap in our collection - books that explicitly address reading struggles while remaining engaging rather than didactic. The Asian-American protagonist adds needed diversity, and the mother-daughter relationship provides representation for single-parent families. The AI/technology hook will attract reluctant readers who gravitate toward contemporary topics.

**Circulation Potential:** HIGH. Based on 20+ years of library experience, books that mirror students' struggles while offering hope consistently circulate well. The POV rescue video concept taps into current social media trends (TikTok POV videos) that our 4th-5th graders are very aware of. Estimated circulation: 25-30 times per year, well above our 8-10 average.

**Accessibility Considerations:** The book's focus on phonics and reading struggles makes it particularly valuable for book talks with struggling readers. The contemporary setting and technology themes reduce stigma around needing reading support. However, we'd need the audiobook version to fully support our most struggling readers.

**Budget Impact:** At $15-20 per hardcover, purchasing 5-6 copies for circulation is reasonable ($75-120). The high anticipated circulation rate justifies the investment.

### Top Recommendations
1. Publish audiobook version narrated by diverse voice actor for accessibility
2. Create book club discussion guide for small group reading interventions
3. Develop author visit/virtual visit programming to boost engagement
4. Add QR codes linking to parent resources about Science of Reading
5. Consider graphic novel adaptation for reluctant readers
6. Include pronunciation guide for character names to support read-alouds

### Key Concerns
1. Limited availability in audiobook format may exclude most struggling readers
2. Single title limits sustained engagement - will there be a series?
3. Price point may be high for budget-constrained library purchases
4. Technology themes may date quickly as AI tools evolve
5. Need classroom sets (30+ copies) for book club use, not just library circulation

## Sample 4: Special Education Coordinator Evaluation

**Persona:** Special Ed Coordinator Sam #8  
**Overall Rating:** 9.0/10

### Scores
- Market Appeal: 8/10
- Genre Fit: 9/10
- Audience Alignment: 10/10

### Detailed Feedback

From a special education perspective, Maya's Story Reel is exceptional - it directly addresses the emotional and academic challenges our struggling readers face daily while modeling evidence-based intervention strategies. The Science of Reading alignment makes this highly relevant for our literacy intervention programs.

**Intervention Tool Value:** This book serves multiple IEP-related functions: 1) Bibliotherapy for students with reading-related anxiety, 2) Explicit phonics instruction modeling for parents, 3) Self-advocacy skill building, and 4) Growth mindset development. The SoRogue AI companion metaphor could help students conceptualize their own assistive technology tools.

**Student Identification Potential:** Many struggling readers resist identification or feel stigmatized by intervention services. Maya's story normalizes reading challenges and shows that smart, creative students can struggle with reading. This could increase parent buy-in for early intervention services and reduce student resistance to pullout services.

**Accommodations Compatibility:** The book's structure (short chapters, contemporary themes, emotional resonance) makes it accessible for students with attention challenges. However, we'd need the audiobook for students with dyslexia or significant decoding challenges. The text complexity should be analyzed - is it at Maya's level (struggling 4th grade) or above?

**Evidence-Based Alignment:** Strong alignment with Science of Reading, structured literacy approaches, and social-emotional learning frameworks. The parent education component is particularly valuable - many of our parents don't understand why we're shifting to explicit phonics instruction.

**Cost-Benefit for Special Ed Budget:** Intervention materials budget is tight, but this serves multiple functions (academic and social-emotional). For 40-50 students in reading intervention, we'd need 8-10 copies for small group instruction ($120-200). This is cost-effective compared to typical intervention materials ($500-1000 per program).

### Top Recommendations
1. Develop IEP goal bank aligned to themes and skills in the book
2. Create progress monitoring tools for reading attitudes and phonics application
3. Design parent education sessions using the book as discussion framework
4. Develop comprehension questions at multiple complexity levels for differentiation
5. Add sensory-friendly format options (dyslexia-friendly font, spacing)
6. Create social stories and discussion cards for students with autism
7. Develop connection activities linking book to students' own assistive technology
8. Include professional development for special ed teachers on implementation

### Key Concerns
1. Text complexity level unclear - may be too difficult for struggling readers without support
2. Limited accessibility options (audiobook, large print, dyslexia-friendly format) at launch
3. Effectiveness depends heavily on teacher facilitation - training required
4. AI technology theme may confuse students about appropriate assistive technology use
5. Need evidence this reduces reading anxiety and improves phonics skills - not just engagement
6. Sustainability - is publisher committed to accessible format production?
7. Parent communication critical to prevent misunderstanding about AI in education
8. May need supplementary materials for students with intellectual disabilities
