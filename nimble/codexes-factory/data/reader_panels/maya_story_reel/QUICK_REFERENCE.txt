TOP 3 STRENGTHS
================================================================================
1. AUDIENCE ALIGNMENT (9.0/10)
   ✓ Perfect fit for struggling readers
   ✓ Addresses reading anxiety and stigma
   ✓ Multi-functional: intervention, library, classroom

2. GENRE FIT (8.5/10)
   ✓ Strong Science of Reading alignment
   ✓ Common Core standards compatibility
   ✓ Contemporary themes engage reluctant readers

3. EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH
   ✓ Explicit phonics instruction modeling
   ✓ Growth mindset and self-advocacy

TOP 3 CONCERNS
================================================================================
1. LACK OF AUDIOBOOK/ACCESSIBLE FORMATS (75% of personas)
   → CRITICAL for target audience (struggling readers)
   → Need: dyslexia-friendly fonts, large print, audio version

2. INSUFFICIENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH (125% mentions - multiple per persona)
   → Curriculum directors require evidence before large-scale adoption
   → Need controlled pilot study with measurable outcomes

3. SUSTAINABILITY UNCLEAR (75% of personas)
   → Single title limits sustained engagement
   → Need series commitment from publisher

CRITICAL PUBLISHER ACTIONS
================================================================================
IMMEDIATE (Weeks 1-4):
  □ Develop audiobook version (diverse narrator)
  □ Create teacher's guide with standards alignment
  □ Design parent education materials (Science of Reading)

SHORT-TERM (Months 2-6):
  □ Ensure accessible formats (dyslexia-friendly, large print)
  □ Develop professional development modules
  □ Create assessment/progress monitoring tools

LONG-TERM (6-12 months):
  □ Conduct pilot study (5-10 schools, 200-300 students)
  □ Develop series roadmap for sustained engagement
  □ Partner with literacy researchers for credibility
