thinking and consideration of planning as an integrated approach suitable for practical
application; synergies and trade-offs
• Considering multiple levels of governance and levels of assessment and adaptation action
• Adaptation in relation to societal development needs and values, and adaptation as both a
stand-alone, iterative and continuous, mainstreamed activity
Section 3: Technical Guidelines
• Scoping and goal setting (analysis of current risk management capacities; and analysis of
impact of adaptation measures on equity and justice outcomes; identification of risk
distribution and risk tolerance across communities, regions and time scales; assessment of
sectoral and development policies, data and knowledge sources, resources, enablers and
barriers; identifying and addressing information gaps)
• Impact, vulnerability and risk assessment (analysis of climate impacts, including
economic and non-economic losses and damages; relationship between global temperature
goals and adapting to their impacts; assessment of climate risks, considering climatic and
non-climatic risk drivers; identification of new and emerging risks; analysis of tolerance of
residual risk; demand for adaptation; assessing uncertainty)
• Planning (identifying entry points for adaptation; participatory and inclusive planning
processes; mainstreaming adaptation in existing policies, regulations and practices; costs
and benefits, and budgeting of adaptation; identifying, appraising and prioritising adaptation
options using criteria such as effectiveness, adequacy, feasibility, equity, synergies and
trade-offs; iterative planning)
• Implementation (identifying roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders; identifying
and mobilizing resources; development of workflow and institutional collaboration
mechanisms; development of communication channels)
• Learning, monitoring and evaluation (impact, thematic targets and adaptation metrics and
indicators to monitor and track progress, uptake and performance; systematic tracking of
lessons and feedback from implementation for continuous learning and adaptive
management; ex-post evaluations including equity and justice outcomes)
