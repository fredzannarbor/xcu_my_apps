With a surprising family secret revealed by her homemade contraption, Mia not only conquers her reading hurdle but inspires her cousins to reach for the stars in this out-of-this-world tale of perseverance and cosmic curiosity.",

But her ADHD makes reading instructions choppy and frustrating, especially when the bot glitches on her commands. As she dives into the 2025 Bot Buddies craze, Aaliyah discovers that programming the robot requires fluent voice scripts\u2014practicing aloud until her words flow smoothly. With a breakthrough in a holographic workshop, she masters fluency and rallies her friends to code their own reading adventures, proving that even farm kids can hack the future.",

Set in a lively music club and a fantastical soundwave world, with a twist where the AI anticipates his every move, Jamal overcomes frustration to master fluency and inspires his new family, making this a heart-pumping tale of rhythm and resilience.",
