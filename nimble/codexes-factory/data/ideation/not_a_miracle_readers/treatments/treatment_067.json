Her gaps in sight word recognition cause holographic spirits to glitch and vanish, fueling her frustration. But as she practices instant word recall to anchor the spirits in canyon visions, Kayla's cultural devotion sparks mastery. With mischievous spirits borrowing trinkets until words are chanted right, she guides her kin through epic revivals, weaving sight words into the fabric of their heritage.",
