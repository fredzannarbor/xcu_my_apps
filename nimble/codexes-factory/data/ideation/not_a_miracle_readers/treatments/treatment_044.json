    "premise": "Amid the rhythmic pulse of Detroit's streets, 9-year-old Jamal Thompson, juggling ADHD and a single mom's busy life, turns to 2025's AI music craze to craft viral beats, but vague words stump his lyric game. Transforming the garage into a neon-lit virtual studio, he hunts context clues in songs to build his vocab, evolving from mix-up mishaps to word wizardry. When his creation unearths a surprising family melody, Jamal not only masters reading's tricky terms but rallies his crew for an epic show, proving beats and books can harmonize in this high-energy story of self-expression and growth.",
