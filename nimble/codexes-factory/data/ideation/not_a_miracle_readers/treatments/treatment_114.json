When she realizes that syncing beats in her VR world mirrors the rhythm of expressive reading, Lila transforms her frustration into fluid mastery, creating a symphony that honors her blended family. Along the way, she teaches her siblings to read with the same musical groove\u2014and discovers an ancient family melody hidden in the app's code.",
