    "premise": "In the bustling streets of Detroit, 10-year-old coding whiz Jamal Thompson dreams of building robots to help his neighborhood, but his dyslexia makes decoding long words feel like an impossible glitch. When he discovers an AI coding buddy that breaks down commands like puzzle pieces, Jamal learns to chunk multisyllabic words just like code, turning his frustration into a triumphant breakthrough. As he masters the skill and programs a bot to clean up local parks, Jamal not only fixes his reading woes but also inspires his friends\u2014and uncovers a surprising family secret hidden in the code.",
