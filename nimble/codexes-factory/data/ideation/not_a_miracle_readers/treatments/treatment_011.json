    "premise": "In the heart of Kansas farmland, 10-year-old Aaliyah Thompson dreams of turning her family's old barn into a high-tech haven with her new AI companion robot. But her ADHD makes reading instructions choppy and frustrating, especially when the bot glitches on her commands. As she dives into the 2025 Bot Buddies craze, Aaliyah discovers that programming the robot requires fluent voice scripts\u2014practicing aloud until her words flow smoothly. With a breakthrough in a holographic workshop, she masters fluency and rallies her friends to code their own reading adventures, proving that even farm kids can hack the future.",
