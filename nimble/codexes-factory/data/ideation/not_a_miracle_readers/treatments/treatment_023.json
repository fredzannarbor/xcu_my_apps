    "premise": "In the dusty heart of New Mexico, 10-year-old Mia Rodriguez dreams of becoming a coder, but her dyslexia makes decoding long words feel like an impossible glitch. When she discovers an AI coding app that turns reading into interactive puzzles, Mia's frustration turns to triumph as she breaks down syllables like code blocks during a high-stakes hackathon. With a quirky virtual pueblo realm and a twist where the app's malfunction threatens her town's power, Mia not only masters multisyllabic words but teaches her community the power of persistence, blending tech passion with literacy breakthroughs in this engaging middle-grade adventure.",
