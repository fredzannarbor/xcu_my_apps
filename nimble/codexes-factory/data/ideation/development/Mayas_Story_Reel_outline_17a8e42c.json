As she replays the clip on her tablet during recess, the Sora app pings with a new chat feature: SoRogue, a quirky young female science nerd AI who quotes Maya Angelou—'There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you'—and suggests her next prompt to channel that storytelling energy. However, her enthusiasm wanes when Ms. Albright announces reading group, focusing on a new phonics pattern. Maya struggles to decode a decodable text, feeling a familiar knot of frustration. She watches Chloe and Leo confidently sound out words, isolating her further. After school, Maya retreats to her room, chatting with SoRogue about a new rescue idea while dodging homework.\n**Emotional Beats:** Initial joy and viral validation from Sora success, quickly replaced by anxiety, frustration, and inadequacy in class.
