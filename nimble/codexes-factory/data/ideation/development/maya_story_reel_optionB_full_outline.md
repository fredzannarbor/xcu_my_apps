## Introductory Guidance

### Creative Considerations

- Maintain Thorn as the AI security/engagement antagonist throughout; all former 'principal' references have been replaced.
- Follow the correct phonics sequence: ch/sh → ea → igh, ensuring consistency across chapters.
- Preserve the emotional arc: Chapters 1–6 show Animals Rescuing Children (dependence to safety); Chapters 7–11 show Children Rescuing Animals (agency and mastery).
- Simplify or adapt literary quotes to suit ages 9–10 while keeping thematic intent intact.

### Learning and Theme Considerations

- Preserve an empathy-first tone in all Sora prompts; keep under 45 words and focus on courage, care, and connection.
- Use present tense and sensory language in every POV story to maintain immersive Sora-style realism.
- Ensure contrast between SoRogue (learning ally) and Thorn (engagement manipulator) is dramatized but not caricatured.
- Each chapter should demonstrate incremental literacy or emotional-growth skills aligned with structured literacy goals.

## SoRogue Prompt Sets

### Animals Rescuing Children (Chapters 1–6)

**Ch 1:** POV: You're a brave girl swimmer caught in a raging riptide, completely helpless as the current pulls you under. A clever female dolphin appears, gently lifts you onto her back with her snout, and smoothly rides the riptide parallel to shore until she can safely deposit you on the beach next to a 'WARNING: DANGEROUS RIPTIDES' sign.
**Ch 2:** POV: You're a young girl trapped waist-deep in thick quicksand mud at low tide, sinking slowly and unable to pull yourself free. A gentle baby otter playfully pushes a long driftwood branch toward you, chattering encouragement as you grab it and use it to pull yourself to solid ground.
**Ch 3:** POV: You're a female hiker buried up to your shoulders in snow after an avalanche, arms trapped and unable to move. A loyal she-bear uses her powerful paws to carefully dig you out, then nudges you onto her back and carries you down the mountain to safety.
**Ch 4:** POV: You're a brave girl trapped on the top floor of an earthquake-shattered building, unable to reach the collapsed stairs. A brilliant parrot flies through the broken windows, circles to show you the only safe path through the debris, then guides you step-by-step to a rescue ladder.
**Ch 5:** POV: You're a girl surfer knocked unconscious by a huge wave, floating face-down in churning tsunami waters. A young seal pup dives beneath you, flips you onto her back to keep your head above water, and rides the massive waves with expert grace until depositing you safely on high ground.
**Ch 6:** POV: You're a young girl climber frozen with fear on a narrow canyon ledge as a rockslide blocks your path down. An eagle chick too young to carry you instead drops small stones to show you hidden handholds, guiding you safely around the rockslide to solid ground.

### Children Rescuing Animals (Chapters 7–11)

**Ch 7:** POV: You're a girl explorer who finds a she-monkey with her tail caught in an old hunting trap deep in the rainforest. Using your wilderness skills, you study the trap mechanism, carefully spring it open, then apply first aid from your pack while the grateful monkey's family watches from the trees.
**Ch 8:** POV: You're a brave girl who discovers a shadow fox trapped in a flooding cave, unable to swim against the strong current to reach the exit. You dive down with a rope, secure it to the fox, then use your strength and swimming skills to tow her through the underwater passage to safety.
**Ch 9:** POV: You're a young girl engineer who finds a chimp trapped in an old mining cart that's locked and slowly rolling toward a cliff. You quickly calculate the cart's trajectory, build a makeshift brake system from cables and pulleys, then lever the door open just in time for the chimp to leap to safety.
**Ch 10:** POV: You're a girl hiker who encounters an adventure elephant trapped in a deep pit with walls too steep to climb. You organize a complex rescue: fashioning a ramp from logs, using vines as guide ropes, and coordinating with other elephants to pull while you dig footholds, working together to free the exhausted elephant.
**Ch 11:** POV: You're a brave girl who discovers all the rescued animals' digital memories being corrupted by a malicious virus flood. You team up with your AI ally SoRogue, writing code together to build firewalls, restore lost data, and create a backup system that protects not just animals but helps other children rescue their own digital stories forever.
