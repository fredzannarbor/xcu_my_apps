He would attend school at Morris University and New York University. He did pioneer work in the development of the electric launch and in the application of gasoline engines in marine craft. Sutphen joined Elco in 1892,where he initiated the design of the submarine chasers and in April 1915 signed a contract with the British for fifty 80 foot Motor Launches. Before the outbreak of World War Two, he brought interest of the Patrol Torpedo Boat to the United States Navy. It would be under his supervision that the PT boats were built for the Navy. Long prominent in the ship building industry, Sutphen was the Executive Vice President of the Elco Naval Division of the Electric Boat Company in Bayonne, New Jersey. He was also the director of the Sutphen Product Corporation and of Canadair LTD, of Canada. Sutphen was 75 years old when he died of a stroke in his home at 876 Park Avenue in New York.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces Irwin Chase was considered to be one of the “founding fathers” of the extremely successful American PT boat program. Chase, a University of Michigan Naval architecture graduate of 1905, became fascinated early in his career with small, fast power boats and according to Elco, created the first “planing” hulled power boat. In 1915, Chase is also credited for designing the Elco Cruisette, then considered to be the world’s most popular cruising power boat during the years between the two world wars. In February of 1939, Elco’s Henry R Sutphen asked Mr. Chase to accompany him on the Queen Mary at the request of President Roosevelt (FDR) to evaluate and purchase at their discretion one of England’s motor torpedo boats. Irwin Chase was a critical part of the design team that allowed Elco to become the largest manufacturer of American PT boats at its newly built extensive facility at Bayonne, New Jersey. Eventually he transferred from Bayonne, to the Electric Boat facility in Connecticut in 1949. He created his home in Deep River, CT. Chase died on May 9,1974 at the age of 90.

He studied yacht design under Henry Douglas Bacon and was "loaned" to naval architect Morris Whitaker for a brief assignment to New York in 1912. When work at Bath slowed down, Tremaine answered a newspaper ad for a draftsman and was hired by Elco in March, 1913. Tremaine became Irwin Chase's apprentice and assistant draftsman until the 1923. Tremaine carried on the Elco design traditions that Chase began in 1906, and he drew wonderful cruisers and motor yachts through the Roaring Twenties, aided by his new assistant, Alfred "Bill" Fleming. It was Tremaine that padlocked the doors, to end Elco's long history of wooden boat building in 1949. He would go on to open his own company building boats called Tremaine Yacht Works in Ship Bottom New Jersey. (Glenville Tremaine).}}{7}{}\protected@file@percent }

They believed that small, seaworthy motor boats, capable of high speeds would make for a useful fighting craft. Preliminary talks resulted in an understanding that if they succeeded in purchasing one of the 70 foot Scott-Paine designed boats, the Navy would purchase in accordance with the terms of a contract tentatively agreed upon by Elco and the Navy. Negotiations for the Scott-Paine designed craft were successful and on March 17, 1939 Sutphen reported by radio that the boat was purchased under favorable terms with shipment to America in three months.

The Government acquisition of the boat was to take place on November 1, 1939, but the delivery date would be postponed until January 1940. In reality the delay was almost six months but it gave the Elco company time to study the construction of the boat as they were prepared to build their own version of the Scott-Paine design. Elco would base its first series of boats upon this Scott-Paine model, and the delivery delay gave engineers an ample opportunity to examine the boat, look into its construction principles, and adapt or modify the design characteristics of the English boat to best suit the needs of our Navy.

The Navy Department made an award to Elco to build 10 motor torpedo boats, PT’s 10-20 and 12 motor boat sub chasers PTC’s 1-12. The first step in the construction of the boat was the assembly of the prefabricated main frames on a building jig which is a double 12- by 12-inch wooden base extending the entire length of the boat. The frames are built of wood braced with plywood. This framework will undergo many assembly stages before completion. (Irwin Chase)}}{25}{}\protected@file@percent }

The chine, which is the hull member forming the joint between the bottom of the hull and the sides, is made of spruce and also bolted on. Spruce diagonal frames on the hull sides and longitudinal battens on the bottom are notched into the main frames and fastened with brass screws. Intermediate frames between the main frames are similarly installed in the three forward compartments. The hull is now ready for planking.

Here is one of the best photos showing the torpedo impulse chamber and the white button that would have been hit with a mallet to discharge the torpedo. Here you can clearly see in this photo the mallet held by this Sailor ready to strike that button for the impulse chamber. The humid climate of the Pacific would sometimes cause these charges to misfire, by not putting enough force behind the torpedo to fully eject it from the tube.

These mounts were completely automatic, as gunner’s had only to manipulate the gun, to aim at the target when the turret and the yoke follow all the movements of the gun sufficiently, so that the aim can be kept on the target all the time.

They each had butterfly flap valves fitted in the main exhaust pipes after the muffler take off which were operated by a lever system to allow straight through exhaust for running at higher speed or to direct the exhaust down through the mufflers to silence the boat at low speed. When exhaust was sent out beneath the water the boats could run in basically a silent mode, making them less noticeable to the enemy.
