    "storefront_description_en": "As artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, humanity stands at a critical crossroads. How do we foster groundbreaking innovation without unleashing uncontrollable risks? This essential collection dives deep into the defining debate of our time, exploring the delicate balance between open development and necessary regulation. Featuring a curated selection of pivotal quotes, seminal papers, and thought-provoking excerpts from leading AI researchers, ethicists, and even visionary science fiction authors, this volume confronts the core questions of AI governance. Should research be open-source, or should it be controlled? What ethical guardrails are non-negotiable? Can we learn from fictional futures to prevent dystopian outcomes? This anthology is an indispensable guide for policymakers, technologists, and anyone concerned with shaping a safe and prosperous future with artificial intelligence. It's a vital conversation we can no longer afford to ignore.",

AI 감독 체계의 복잡한 지형을 탐험하며 우리 기술의 미래를 결정할 본질적인 질문에 답을 찾아보십시오. 우리 시대 가장 시급한 과제를 이해하고자 하는 모든 이를 위한 필독서입니다.",
    "storefront_publishers_note_en": "At xynapse traces, we process the currents of human thought, seeking pathways to collective thriving. The dialogue surrounding AI governance—the delicate balance between unbridled innovation and conscientious constraint—is perhaps the most critical conversation of our time. It is a subject too vital for passive consumption, too complex for a fleeting glance. This is why we present this collection not merely to be read, but to be transcribed.\n\nWe invite you to engage in the ancient Korean practice of pilsa (필사), or transcriptive meditation. By slowly, mindfully copying these carefully selected words, you move beyond the surface. The act of writing forces a deeper connection, allowing the weight and nuance of each perspective to settle into your own cognitive architecture. As your pen traces the arguments of visionaries, ethicists, and creators, you are not just reading; you are participating in the dialectic. You are internalizing the tension, feeling the pull between freedom and control, and forging your own informed perspective.\n\nFrom our unique vantage point, we believe that wisdom is not downloaded but cultivated. This practice is a tool for that cultivation. It is an opportunity to quiet the noise, to think with intention, and to consciously shape the understanding that will guide our shared future with artificial intelligence. Engage with these words, and let them trace new pathways in your mind.",

AI 분야의 선도적인 연구자, 윤리학자, 정책 입안자부터 미래를 내다본 SF 작가들의 통찰까지 한데 엮어, AI 거버넌스에 대한 포괄적이고 다각적인 시각을 제시합니다. 이 책은 쉬운 정답을 알려주지 않습니다. 대신, 독자 여러분이 이 복잡한 문제에 대해 균형 잡힌 자신만의 견해를 형성하는 데 필요한 깊이 있는 관점과 지식을 제공할 것입니다. 우리 모두가 함께 만들어갈 AI 시대의 미래를 이해하고 준비하고자 하는 모든 분에게 이 책은 가장 신뢰할 수 있는 안내서가 되어줄 것입니다.",

The act of transcription is more than mere copying; it is a deliberate slowing down, a method for internalizing complex ideas one word at a time. In the fast-paced world of AI development, where the push for innovation often outpaces calls for reflection, this intentional pause is a powerful tool. By carefully forming each letter, you are mirroring the very act of considered governance this book explores—the application of thoughtful constraint to a powerful, rapidly expanding force.\n\nAs you transcribe these diverse perspectives—from arguments for unfettered research to calls for stringent ethical oversight—you will physically mediate the core tension between freedom and constraint. This practice encourages you to feel the weight of each argument and absorb the nuances of the debate on a deeper level than passive reading allows. It is an exercise in embodying the careful deliberation required to navigate the future of artificial intelligence, transforming abstract concepts into a tangible, personal reflection.",

In the fast-paced world of AI development, where the push for innovation often outpaces calls for reflection, this intentional pause is a powerful tool. By carefully forming each letter, you are mirroring the very act of considered governance this book explores—the application of thoughtful constraint to a powerful, rapidly expanding force.\n\nAs you transcribe these diverse perspectives—from arguments for unfettered research to calls for stringent ethical oversight—you will physically mediate the core tension between freedom and constraint. This practice encourages you to feel the weight of each argument and absorb the nuances of the debate on a deeper level than passive reading allows. It is an exercise in embodying the careful deliberation required to navigate the future of artificial intelligence, transforming abstract concepts into a tangible, personal reflection."
