Through the contemplative practice of *pilsa*\u2014hand-copying texts\u2014we believe readers forge a deeper connection with ideas crucial to humanity's understanding, capabilities, and contributions to the universe.\n\nOur Artificial Intelligence stream explores a domain rapidly reshaping our reality. This volume, *AI-Driven Science: Speed versus Safety*, tackles a pivotal tension at the heart of progress. AI promises to turbocharge scientific discovery: imagine designing life-saving drugs in days, deciphering cosmic mysteries with unprecedented clarity, or crafting sustainable solutions for our planet at lightning speed. The 'speed' is exhilarating, a testament to human ingenuity amplified.\n\nHowever, velocity without direction can be perilous. The 'safety' we explore is not about stifling innovation, but about ensuring its responsible stewardship. When does the race for breakthroughs eclipse the need for ethical deliberation or foresight into unintended consequences? This question is no longer academic; it\u2019s at our doorstep.\n\nEngaging with these complex issues through *pilsa* allows for a unique form of internalization. Transcribing the arguments herein encourages a nuanced grappling with the stakes involved\u2014moving beyond headlines to the core of the debate. This book doesn't offer easy answers. Instead, it seeks to illuminate the intricate balance required to harness AI's immense power for science in a way that is both transformative and thoughtfully managed, ensuring that our reach for the stars doesn't cause us to stumble here on Earth. Understanding this dynamic is vital for anyone invested in a future where progress and prudence walk hand in hand."

This question is particularly acute when these machines are driving scientific discovery itself. An AI optimizing for, say, a novel chemical compound with specific properties might stumble upon something incredibly dangerous if its objectives are not perfectly aligned with human safety and values. The speed at which AI can explore vast solution spaces means that such discoveries could happen much faster than our ability to anticipate or mitigate the risks. Thus, while the potential benefits of AI-accelerated science are enormous, so too are the potential pitfalls if we fail to solve the control problem before deploying superintelligent scientific discovery systems.",
