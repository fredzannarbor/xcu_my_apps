              "text": "The line between the tool and its user is blurring. Nowhere is this merger more profound, or more perilous, than in the domain of neural augmentation. For every promise of liberation\u2014instantaneous learning, the cure of neurological disease, a richer sensory existence\u2014a shadow of dependency follows. When does a cognitive enhancement become a cognitive leash? At what point does the mind we fuse with a machine cease to be our own?\n\nThese are not questions for hurried consumption. They demand slow, deliberate contemplation, which is the very purpose of this transcriptive volume. The practice of pilsa, of transcribing these explorations by hand, provides an essential counter-rhythm to the technological acceleration we are examining. To write a thought is to inhabit it, to weigh its structure and implications in a way that passive reading cannot. It is a method for forging your own neural pathways on this topic, independent of any chip.\n\nThe conversation about mind-machine fusion is happening now, in laboratories and boardrooms. Without a thoughtful, engaged public, the future of human consciousness will be designed by the few. This book is an invitation to the drawing board, offering a framework for navigating the most intimate technology humanity has ever conceived.\n\nOur mission is to enhance human capability. That requires us to confront not only what we might gain from our tools, but what we stand to lose. This volume is not a road map, but a compass. We offer it to help you find your own bearings in the astonishing and unsettling territory that lies ahead."

The Cyborg deliberately incorporates exogenous components extending the self-regulatory control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments. The ultimate reason for any prosthesis is to provide a man-machine system which is more effective than either alone. The prosthesis is coupled to the organism\u2019s own homeostatic controls. The Cyborg is the result. If man in space, in addition to flying his vehicle, must continuously be checking on things and making adjustments merely in order to keep himself alive, he becomes a slave to the machine. The purpose of the Cyborg, as well as his own homeostatic systems, is to provide an organizational system in which such robot-like problems are taken care of automatically and unconsciously, leaving man free to explore, to create, to think, and to feel. He can thus be more human than he is on earth, where so much of his time and energy are spent in the drudgery of specific servo-mechanisms.",

Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction. The international women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century. It is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion. Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs\u2014creatures simultaneously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings between organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality.",

We shall be cyborgs in the sense that the flow of reason and the stream of consciousness will in the future routinely involve a looping process in which the biological brain partners and collaborates with nonbiological circuitry. This is not a case of the biological brain using a few external props, but of a genuine intermingling of biological and nonbiological resources in the service of thought and reason. In this vision, the biological brain is not so much the pinnacle of creation as a quirky but powerful device that has evolved to make the most of what is available, and what is available is now a whole lot more. The human mind, if this picture is correct, is not a static and enduring object. It is a shifting, opportunistic coalition of biological and nonbiological problem-solvers. This looping, mingling, and coalescing is what I mean by the label 'natural-born cyborg'. We are, at root, thinkers and reasoners whose minds and selves are spread across biological brain and nonbiological circuitry.",

Whether it is a human being, a domestic animal, or a coil of wire, it makes no electrical or mechanical difference. What is not used as an element of a machine is not an element of the machine. Thus, in the new industrial revolution, the worker with the pick and shovel is replaced by the mechanical digger, which is simply a single machine. The varied human capacities are degraded by the machine to the level of the strictly-defined performance of a trigger-puller. The automatic machine is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor which competes with slave labor must accept the economic conditions of slave labor. It is perfectly clear that this will produce an unemployment situation, in comparison with which the present recession and even the depression of the thirties will seem a pleasant joke. This depression will ruin many industries\u2014possibly even the industries which have taken advantage of the new potentialities.

This is not a prophecy, it is a possibility. Preventing it will be a huge challenge. While some humans will upgrade themselves into godlike cyborgs, the algorithms might make the remaining Homo sapiens completely useless. The same technology that can upgrade humans can also push them out of the job market. What will people do all day in a post-work world? One answer might be computer games. Unemployed people might devote increasing amounts of time and attention to 3D virtual reality worlds, which would provide them with far more excitement and emotional engagement than the \u2018real\u2019 world outside.
