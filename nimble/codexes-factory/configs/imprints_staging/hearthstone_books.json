This allows for the primary text to run in the main column while expert commentary, definitions, or contextual notes are placed in the margin or a secondary column. This 'dialogue' format is crucial. High-quality facsimiles of original documents must be integrated thoughtfully, with clear callouts and captions linking them to the relevant text.",
        "typesetting_requirements": "A sophisticated and flexible typographic system is essential. Use a classic, readable serif font for the primary source text to evoke a historical feel. A complementary but distinct font (either a different serif or a clean sans-serif) should be used for the commentary to create a clear separation. Special styles will be needed for annotations, footnotes/endnotes, pull quotes, and source citations. Legibility across different text types is paramount.",
        "functional_elements": "This imprint requires robust navigational tools. A detailed table of contents, a comprehensive index, and a glossary of key terms are mandatory. A system for cross-referencing between the primary text and commentary (e.g., marginal line numbers, section markers) is critical for usability. Extensive footnotes or endnotes will be a standard feature.",
        "reader_interaction_model": "The reader is expected to engage in comparative reading—analyzing the primary source and then immediately consulting the expert commentary. The design must support this non-linear path, allowing the reader to easily switch focus between historical text and modern analysis on the same page or spread."
      },
      "reasoning": "A 'standard' codextype is insufficient because the imprint's core mission is to present two distinct but related bodies of text—primary sources and expert analysis—in a single, accessible volume. The 'textbook' codextype is recommended for its structured approach to presenting complex information with aids like sidebars and annotations. The 'reference' codextype is included for its emphasis on strong navigational tools like indexing and cross-referencing, which are vital for making dense historical material accessible to the educated layperson, fulfilling the imprint's charter."
