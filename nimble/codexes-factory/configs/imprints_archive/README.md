# Imprints Archive Directory

**Purpose:** Historical, experimental, and deprecated imprint configurations

## Status: ARCHIVE

This directory contains imprint configurations that are no longer active in production but are preserved for historical reference, audit trails, or potential future reuse.

## Contents

### Categories

1. **Superseded Configurations**
   - Older versions replaced by updated configs
   - Maintained for version history
   - Useful for rollback if needed

2. **Deprecated Imprints**
   - Imprints no longer in active use
   - Sunset or discontinued
   - Preserved for records

3. **Experimental Concepts**
   - Proof-of-concept configurations
   - Research or exploration
   - Not intended for production

4. **Abandoned Drafts**
   - Development efforts discontinued
   - Superseded by alternative approaches
   - Preserved for learning/reference

## File Naming Convention

When archiving, use descriptive naming:

```
{imprint_name}_{reason}_{date}.json
```

Examples:
- `xynapse_traces_v1_20250901.json` (superseded version)
- `experimental_ai_imprint_20250815.json` (experimental)
- `old_publishing_draft_abandoned_20250820.json` (abandoned)

## Archiving Process

### From Production

When updating a production config:

```bash
# Archive old version
cp configs/imprints/{imprint}.json configs/imprints_archive/{imprint}_v1_$(date +%Y%m%d).json

# Update production
cp {new_config}.json configs/imprints/{imprint}.json

# Commit both
git add configs/imprints/{imprint}.json configs/imprints_archive/{imprint}_v1_*.json
git commit -m "feat: Update {imprint} config (archived v1)"
```

### From Staging/Draft

For abandoned development:

```bash
mv configs/imprints_draft/{imprint}.json configs/imprints_archive/{imprint}_abandoned_$(date +%Y%m%d).json
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Archive abandoned {imprint} draft"
```

## Retrieval Process

### Restore from Archive

If you need to restore an archived config:

```bash
# Copy from archive
cp configs/imprints_archive/{imprint}_v1_20250901.json configs/imprints_draft/{imprint}.json

# Review and update as needed
# Promote through normal workflow: draft → staging → production
```

### Reference Only

For reference without restoration:

```bash
# View archived config
cat configs/imprints_archive/{imprint}_*.json
```

## Maintenance

### Periodic Review

- **Quarterly:** Review archive for configs no longer needed
- **Annually:** Consolidate very old archives

### Compression

For very old archives (>2 years):

```bash
# Create compressed archive of old configs
tar -czf configs/imprints_archive/archive_2023.tar.gz configs/imprints_archive/*_2023*.json
rm configs/imprints_archive/*_2023*.json
```

## Do Not Archive

❌ Do not archive:
- Active production configs
- Configs under active development
- Configs in staging awaiting promotion

✅ Do archive:
- Superseded production versions
- Deprecated/discontinued imprints
- Abandoned experimental configs
- Historical references
