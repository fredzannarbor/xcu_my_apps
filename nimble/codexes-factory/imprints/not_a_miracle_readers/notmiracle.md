# The Success of Children and Families in School Systems Practicing Methods Like Mississippi's "Science of Reading" Approach

The success of children and families in school systems practicing methods like Mississippi's "Science of Reading" approach requires a combination of specific emotional skills, practical resources, and critical understandings. This approach, also known as structured literacy, is based on explicit, systematic instruction in foundational reading skills and contrasts with methods like "balanced literacy".

## Emotional Skills

### For Children
- **Emotional self-management**: The ability to handle frustrations and discouragement when encountering difficulties with decoding and new spelling patterns.
- **Perseverance and grit**: The determination to stick with challenging tasks, such as systematic phonics practice, knowing that effort is key to improvement. This is also called "reading resilience".
- **Self-awareness**: The capacity to recognize and name their feelings, and a willingness to communicate with teachers or parents when they feel overwhelmed.
- **Resilience**: The skill of bouncing back from setbacks and viewing mistakes as learning opportunities, a mindset reinforced by celebrating effort rather than just achievement.
- **Confidence**: A strong sense of self-efficacy that grows from mastering foundational reading skills through a reliable, systematic process.

### For Families
- **Growth mindset**: A belief that reading is a skill that is taught and learned, rather than an innate ability. This helps parents avoid placing blame or undue stress on a child who struggles.
- **Empathy**: The ability to understand their child's frustrations with challenging tasks and provide encouragement without becoming frustrated themselves.
- **Emotional regulation**: The capacity for parents to manage their own stress or anxiety related to their child's academic performance and maintain a calm, supportive home environment.
- **Patience**: The willingness to accept that progress in reading can be a long-term process, especially for struggling readers, and to celebrate small gains.

## Practical Resources

### For Children
- **High-quality, decodable texts**: Books that are aligned with the specific phonics skills being taught in the classroom. These allow for successful practice and build confidence.
- **Multisensory learning tools**: Items like sand trays for tracing letters, alphabet charts, letter tiles, and other tactile aids to engage multiple senses in the learning process.
- **Structured literacy apps and games**: Digital resources that reinforce phonics and phonemic awareness in an interactive and engaging format.
- **Assistive technology**: Audiobooks or text-to-speech tools that can help children, especially those with dyslexia, access content and develop comprehension skills.
- **A quiet reading space**: A designated area at home for reading and homework to minimize distractions.

### For Families
- **Training and workshops**: Access to parent education workshops that explain the "Science of Reading" and demonstrate structured literacy techniques for home support.
- **Free or low-cost books**: Programs like Dolly Parton's Imagination Library or Reach Out and Read provide access to books for home libraries.
- **Reading guides**: Handouts or online guides from schools that provide concrete activity suggestions, such as rhyming games, writing practice, and vocabulary-building tips.
- **Communication with educators**: A clear and open line of communication with teachers and reading specialists to understand a child's specific needs and track progress.su
- **Peer support networks**: Connections with other families or support groups through parent-teacher organizations or social media to share experiences and strategies.

## Understandings
- **The "Science of Reading" principles**: An understanding of the fundamental components of evidence-based reading instruction, including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.
- **Structured Literacy vs. "Balanced Literacy"**: A clear awareness that structured literacy is a systematic, explicit approach that teaches the structure of the language, in contrast to balanced literacy, which is considered less explicit and can lead to learning gaps.
- **The learning trajectory**: Knowledge that learning to read is not a natural process for all children and that explicit instruction is necessary to build the neural connections required for reading. This is particularly relevant for families of children with dyslexia.
- **The link between literacy and mental health**: An appreciation for how reading proficiency significantly impacts a child's mental well-being, including self-esteem, anxiety, and general psychological functioning.
- **The importance of consistency**: The recognition that home and school must work together consistently to reinforce literacy skills for long-term success. The structured and cumulative nature of the curriculum relies on this reinforcement.
- **Diagnostic and responsive teaching**: An understanding that effective structured literacy involves continuous assessment to pinpoint a child's needs, and that instruction is adjusted accordingly.
