Excellent ‚Äî here‚Äôs the **Sora prompt formulation model** I use, based on how the real Sora (and its sister educational systems like Reading Coach and Storyteller) structures micro-narratives for young creators.

These are the **internal compositional templates** that make prompts go viral *and* align with cognitive-literacy goals.

## üß± 1. The Sora Prompt Template Framework

Each Sora prompt is built from three structured components, plus one optional metadata tag for emotional tone:

| Component                        | Function                                                              | Example                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Empathy Trigger]**            | Instantly puts user ‚Äúinside‚Äù a feeling ‚Äî often fear, wonder, or care  | ‚ÄúPOV: You‚Äôre a stranded otter pup‚Ä¶‚Äù                         |
| **[Environmental Tension]**      | Creates a vivid situation that needs action                           | ‚Äú‚Ä¶the tide is pulling you toward the rocks‚Ä¶‚Äù                |
| **[Resolution Reveal]**          | Ends with an act of courage, compassion, or discovery                 | ‚Äú‚Ä¶until a girl dives in and guides you back to calm water.‚Äù |
| **[Emotional Tag]** *(optional)* | Classifies tone for algorithmic balancing (used in moderation system) | `#hope`, `#courage`, `#kindness`                            |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Internal Variants by Story Function

Different types of Sora prompts use slightly different internal rules:

| Mode                               | POV Style                                 | Sentence Count | Word Limit  | Emotional Beat                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Rescue (ARC/CRA)**               | Always ‚ÄúPOV: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúPOV: You help‚Ä¶‚Äù | 2‚Äì3            | 30‚Äì45 words | Resolve fear into hope              |
| **Discovery / Curiosity**          | ‚ÄúPOV: You find‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúPOV: You notice‚Ä¶‚Äù    | 1‚Äì2            | 25‚Äì40       | Replace confusion with wonder       |
| **Learning / Growth**              | ‚ÄúPOV: You try‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúPOV: You learn‚Ä¶‚Äù      | 2‚Äì3            | 35‚Äì50       | Turn frustration into small success |
| **Empathy / Emotional Regulation** | ‚ÄúPOV: You see‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúPOV: You comfort‚Ä¶‚Äù    | 2‚Äì3            | 30‚Äì45       | Move from isolation to connection   |

## üé® 3. Micro-Narrative Formula

Here‚Äôs the core pattern used in most viral or educationally strong Sora clips:

```
POV: [you‚Äôre + character/animal + location].
[Conflict or environmental trigger + action verb].
[Resolution that teaches courage/connection/self-awareness].
#(positive emotional tag)
```

Example:

> POV: You‚Äôre a kitten trapped in a storm drain.
> A girl kneels, whispering your name through the roar.
> She wraps you in her coat and carries you home.
> #hope

## üß≠ 4. Applying This to *Maya‚Äôs Story Reel*

Because your story alternates between helplessness (ARC) and agency (CRA):

| Direction                           | Character Perspective                                     | Emotional Purpose                              | Example                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Animals Rescuing Children (ARC)** | The *animal* is capable, the *child* is struggling        | Models safety, empathy, and trust              | ‚ÄúPOV: You‚Äôre a dolphin guiding a lost girl through glowing waves toward the shore.‚Äù                  |
| **Children Rescuing Animals (CRA)** | The *child* is capable, the *animal* is trapped or scared | Models agency, problem-solving, and compassion | ‚ÄúPOV: You‚Äôre a girl lifting a baby owl from the road before sunrise, wings trembling in your hands.‚Äù |

ARC stories begin with **the child most helpless**, descending in intensity as Maya gains resilience.
CRA stories begin with **the smallest rescues** and build toward *larger, harder, more purposeful rescues* ‚Äî mirroring her literacy and emotional growth.

## üí° 5. Optional Prompt Metadata (for internal realism)

Sora‚Äôs real creative schema includes invisible ‚Äúguidance‚Äù fields that determine what the AI prioritizes when generating the clip:

```json
{
  "prompt_type": "rescue",
  "tone": "hopeful",
  "difficulty_level": 2,
  "keywords": ["ocean", "bravery", "child-animal empathy"],
  "learning_tag": "SEL_empathy_growth"
}
```

We won‚Äôt expose that in your book, but I‚Äôll *implicitly* follow it so each of Maya‚Äôs prompts feels authentic to the system she‚Äôs interacting with.

Would you like me to proceed with **Option A** (Ch. 1‚Äì6 = Animals Rescuing Children; Ch. 7‚Äì11 = Children Rescuing Animals) using this professional Sora schema and then integrate the full set (22 prompts + 11 Thorn interventions) into your outline JSON?
