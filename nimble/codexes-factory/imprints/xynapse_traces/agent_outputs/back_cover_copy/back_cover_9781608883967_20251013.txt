When raising children or caring for aging parents, should you trust the data or your gut? This question sits at the heart of modern family life, where algorithmic recommendations compete with ancestral wisdom.

Through the lens of pilsa—the Korean practice of mindful copying and contemplation—this book invites you to hold both perspectives simultaneously. Not to choose between spreadsheets and instinct, but to develop the cognitive flexibility to know when each matters most.

You'll explore how families navigate care decisions in an age of endless information: from screen time research that shifts every year to eldercare protocols that ignore individual dignity. Through transcriptive meditation exercises, you'll build the mental clarity to separate signal from noise, and the confidence to act when perfect data doesn't exist.

This isn't a parenting manual or caregiving guide. It's a framework for making better decisions when stakes are high, information is contradictory, and love demands both rigor and intuition.

For anyone supporting family members while drowning in conflicting advice.
