If not, provide the real quote.\n- `verified_source`: The corrected, specific source (e.g., book title, play, or journal).\n- `verified_author`: The corrected author name.\n- `verification_notes`: A brief string explaining your findings, especially if a correction was made (e.g., 'Original was a paraphrase, corrected to exact wording.' or 'Source was incorrect, found in a different work by the same author.').
