# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the nimble_llm_caller library with intelligent context management capabilities. It includes context-size-aware safe submission that automatically handles context overflow by upshifting to more capable models or chunking, and support for attached files in LLM requests. These features ensure reliable operation regardless of input size while expanding the library's capability to handle multi-modal content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using nimble_llm_caller, I want the library to automatically handle context size limits, so that my requests never fail due to token overflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request's context size exceeds the current model's capacity THEN the system SHALL automatically upshift to a more capable model from the same provider
2. WHEN no more capable model exists from the same provider THEN the system SHALL attempt to use a more capable model from a different provider based on a priority tree
3. WHEN upshifting occurs THEN the system SHALL log the model change with the reason for transparency
4. WHEN the original model has sufficient capacity THEN the system SHALL use the originally requested model without modification
5. IF no available model can handle the context size THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the context is too large

#### Additional Acceptance Criteria

6. WHEN the context size is too large for any available model THEN the system SHALL chunk the document into multiple requests that fit the context limit and assemble the results as if it were a single response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure model priority and capacity mappings, so that I can control which models are used for upshifting based on my preferences and available API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to define a priority tree of models with their context capacities
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to specify preferred providers for upshifting
3. WHEN a model is not available (missing API key) THEN the system SHALL skip to the next available model in the priority tree
4. WHEN no priority tree is configured THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults based on common model capabilities
5. IF the configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL raise a clear configuration error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to attach files to my LLM requests, so that I can provide additional context like documents, images, or data files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attaching files to a request THEN the system SHALL support common file types (text, images, PDFs, JSON, etc.)
2. WHEN processing attached files THEN the system SHALL automatically extract and format content appropriately for the target model
3. WHEN a file is too large THEN the system SHALL provide options to chunk or summarize the content
4. WHEN the model doesn't support the file type THEN the system SHALL attempt to convert or extract text content
5. IF file processing fails THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message with the specific failure reason

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file attachments to be included in context size calculations, so that the intelligent upshifting works correctly with multi-modal content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating context size THEN the system SHALL include tokens from all attached files
2. WHEN files contain images THEN the system SHALL estimate token usage based on image dimensions and model specifications
3. WHEN upshifting due to file content THEN the system SHALL preserve all attached files in the new request
4. WHEN the target model doesn't support certain file types THEN the system SHALL convert them to supported formats before upshifting
5. IF file conversion is not possible THEN the system SHALL notify the user and proceed with text-only content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced functionality to integrate seamlessly with existing code, so that I can adopt these features without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing nimble_llm_caller methods THEN all current functionality SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN context-aware features are enabled THEN they SHALL work transparently without requiring code changes
3. WHEN file attachment features are used THEN they SHALL extend existing request patterns naturally
4. WHEN new features are disabled THEN the library SHALL behave exactly as before
5. IF backward compatibility is broken THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily see all prompts and responses from the current session, so that I can debug issues and track my LLM interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is submitted THEN the system SHALL log the request with all relevant details including model, tokens, and content
2. WHEN a response is received THEN the system SHALL log the response with all relevant details including model used, token usage, and response content
3. WHEN the cumulative log exceeds a certain size THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate the log contents to an archive using standard efficient practices
4. WHEN accessing logs THEN the system SHALL provide easy methods to retrieve recent interactions
5. IF log writing fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation and log the failure without breaking the main functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all ad hoc LLM calls in my many software packages with calls to this single package, so that I can standardize my LLM interactions and reduce code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packaging the library THEN the system SHALL be available via private PyPI for easy installation
2. WHEN packaging the library THEN the system SHALL be available via Pyx for alternative distribution
3. WHEN using the library across multiple projects THEN it SHALL provide consistent interfaces and behavior
4. WHEN updating the library THEN existing integrations SHALL continue to work without modification
5. IF distribution channels are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation alternatives
