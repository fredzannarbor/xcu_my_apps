The AI Lab for Book-Lovers demonstrates the use of AI in creating a new publishing imprint with a 10-title list releasing from September 2023 to April 2024. The imprint is a fundamental unit of publishing business activity, and this work presents the first documented case study of its fully AI-assisted creation. This research introduces a novel multi-level configuration system, organized in a five-tier hierarchy (Global → Publisher → Imprint → Tranche → Book), to manage and automate the complexities of imprint development. At the core of our system lies sophisticated LLM orchestration, leveraging models including `anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `google/gemini-pro-1.5`, and `openai/gpt-4-turbo` for AI-assisted content generation, encompassing diverse tasks from idea conception to manuscript refinement. Key technical innovations include an automated publishing pipeline with multi-language support, notably incorporating Korean language processing and seamless LaTeX integration. We present quantitative results and production efficiency metrics demonstrating the impact of AI on reducing time-to-market and streamlining traditionally labor-intensive publishing processes. This study offers significant insights into the potential for automation within the publishing industry and provides a valuable contribution to ongoing AI research in content creation and digital humanities. The xynapse_traces project highlights the feasibility and benefits of integrating AI into all stages of publishing, paving the way for future explorations of AI's transformative role in the creative industries.
