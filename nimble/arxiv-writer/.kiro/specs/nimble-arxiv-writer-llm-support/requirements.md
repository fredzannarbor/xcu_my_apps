# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves abstracting the existing arxiv paper generation functionality from the Codexes Factory codebase into a standalone, reusable arxiv-writer package. The current implementation is tightly coupled to the Codexes Factory project structure and needs to be extracted into a generic, configurable library that can be used by other projects for generating academic papers in arxiv format.

The abstracted package will maintain all existing functionality while providing a clean, extensible API that can be integrated into various workflows. It will support the current Codexes Factory use case through a compatibility layer while enabling broader adoption across different academic and research contexts.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is developed THEN it SHALL include unit tests with >90% code coverage
2. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL pass on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
3. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end paper generation workflows
4. WHEN the package is released THEN all tests SHALL pass in CI/CD pipeline

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want minimal external dependencies, so that I can deploy the package in restricted environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the package SHALL minimize external requirements to essential libraries only
2. WHEN LaTeX is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions for LaTeX distributions
3. WHEN optional features require additional dependencies THEN they SHALL be clearly marked as optional extras
4. WHEN running in containerized environments THEN the package SHALL work with standard Python Docker images

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to isolate this abstraction and package work from the Codexes Factory codebase, so that I can use it independently of the Codexes Factory project structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the package is developed THEN it SHALL NOT affect the Codexes Factory codebase, structure, or data
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies for paper generation
4. WHEN using the package THEN the developer SHALL NOT need to install or configure Codexes Factory components
5. WHEN the package is released THEN it SHALL be installable via pip from PyPI or local sources
6. WHEN the package is released THEN it SHALL work across Python 3.8+ environments
7. WHEN the package is released THEN it SHALL include comprehensive documentation, installation instructions, API reference, and usage examples
8. WHEN the package is released THEN it SHALL include comprehensive testing, ensuring the package works reliably across different environments

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Codexes Factory developer and user, I want to be able to import the new abstracted package and drop it in place of the current implementation with a configuration that provides complete reproduction of the current functionality and paper content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
